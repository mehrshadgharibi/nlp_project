Chemistry,"Chemistry is the scientific study of the properties and behavior of matter. It is a physical science within the natural sciences that studies the chemical elements that make up matter and compounds made of atoms, molecules and ions: their composition, structure, properties, behavior and the changes they undergo during reactions with other substances. Chemistry also addresses the nature of chemical bonds in chemical compounds.
In the scope of its subject, chemistry occupies an intermediate position between physics and biology. It is sometimes called the central science because it provides a foundation for understanding both basic and applied scientific disciplines at a fundamental level. For example, chemistry explains aspects of plant growth (botany), the formation of igneous rocks (geology), how atmospheric ozone is formed and how environmental pollutants are degraded (ecology), the properties of the soil on the Moon (cosmochemistry), how medications work (pharmacology), and how to collect DNA evidence at a crime scene (forensics).
Chemistry has existed under various names since ancient times. It has evolved, and now chemistry encompasses various areas of specialisation, or subdisciplines, that continue to increase in number and interrelate to create further interdisciplinary fields of study. The applications of various fields of chemistry are used frequently for economic purposes in the chemical industry.

Etymology
The word chemistry comes from a modification during the Renaissance of the word alchemy, which referred to an earlier set of practices that encompassed elements of chemistry, metallurgy, philosophy, astrology, astronomy, mysticism, and medicine. Alchemy is often associated with the quest to turn lead or other base metals into gold, though alchemists were also interested in many of the questions of modern chemistry.
The modern word alchemy in turn is derived from the Arabic word al-kīmīā (الكیمیاء). This may have Egyptian origins since al-kīmīā is derived from the Ancient Greek χημία, which is in turn derived from the word Kemet, which is the ancient name of Egypt in the Egyptian language. Alternately, al-kīmīā may derive from χημεία 'cast together'.

Modern principles
The current model of atomic structure is the quantum mechanical model. Traditional chemistry starts with the study of elementary particles, atoms, molecules, substances, metals, crystals and other aggregates of matter. Matter can be studied in solid, liquid, gas and plasma states, in isolation or in combination. The interactions, reactions and transformations that are studied in chemistry are usually the result of interactions between atoms, leading to rearrangements of the chemical bonds which hold atoms together. Such behaviors are studied in a chemistry laboratory.
The chemistry laboratory stereotypically uses various forms of laboratory glassware. However glassware is not central to chemistry, and a great deal of experimental (as well as applied/industrial) chemistry is done without it.

A chemical reaction is a transformation of some substances into one or more different substances. The basis of such a chemical transformation is the rearrangement of electrons in the chemical bonds between atoms. It can be symbolically depicted through a chemical equation, which usually involves atoms as subjects. The number of atoms on the left and the right in the equation for a chemical transformation is equal. (When the number of atoms on either side is unequal, the transformation is referred to as a nuclear reaction or radioactive decay.) The type of chemical reactions a substance may undergo and the energy changes that may accompany it are constrained by certain basic rules, known as chemical laws.
Energy and entropy considerations are invariably important in almost all chemical studies. Chemical substances are classified in terms of their structure, phase, as well as their chemical compositions. They can be analyzed using the tools of chemical analysis, e.g. spectroscopy and chromatography. Scientists engaged in chemical research are known as chemists. Most chemists specialize in one or more sub-disciplines. Several concepts are essential for the study of chemistry; some of them are:

Matter
In chemistry, matter is defined as anything that has rest mass and volume (it takes up space) and is made up of particles. The particles that make up matter have rest mass as well – not all particles have rest mass, such as the photon. Matter can be a pure chemical substance or a mixture of substances.

Atom
The atom is the basic unit of chemistry. It consists of a dense core called the atomic nucleus surrounded by a space occupied by an electron cloud. The nucleus is made up of positively charged protons and uncharged neutrons (together called nucleons), while the electron cloud consists of negatively charged electrons which orbit the nucleus. In a neutral atom, the negatively charged electrons balance out the positive charge of the protons.

Basshunter Dota Revival,"Dota: Dragon's Blood is an adult animated epic fantasy television series. It is based on Dota 2, a 2013 video game by Valve. The show is produced by Studio Mir in association with Ashley Edward Miller's company Kaiju Boulevard. The series premiered on Netflix on March 25, 2021, and concluded on August 11, 2022.

Plot
Set in a fantasy world of magic and mysticism, the story follows a Dragon Knight, Davion, who hunts and slays dragons to make the world a safer place. In a battle between demons and the dragon race of Eldwurm, the dragon Slyrak merges his soul with Davion. Along with the moon princess Mirana, Davion pursues a journey to stop the demon Terrorblade, who wants to kill all dragons and collect their souls.

Voice cast and characters

Digital painting,"Digital painting is either a physical painting made with the use of digital electronics and spray paint robotics within the digital art fine art context or pictorial art imagery made with pixels on a computer screen that mimics artworks from the traditional histories of painting and illustration.

Technological origins
Sketchpad
The earliest graphical manipulation program was called Sketchpad. Created in 1963 by Ivan Sutherland, a grad student at MIT, Sketchpad allowed the user to manipulate objects on a cathode-ray tube (CRT). Sketchpad eventually led to the creation of the Rand Tablet for work on the GRAIL project in 1968, and the very first tablet was created. Other early tablets, or digitizers, like the ID (intelligent digitizer) and the BitPad were commercially successful and used in CAD (Computer Aided Design) programs. Modern-day graphics tablets are the tools of choice by digital painters.

Tablets
The idea of using a tablet to communicate directions to a computer has been an idea since 1968 when the RAND (Research and Development) company out of Santa Monica, developed the RAND tablet that was used to program. Digitizers were popularized in the mid-1970s and early 1980s by the commercial success of the ID (Intelligent Digitizer) and BitPad manufactured by the Summagraphics Corp. These digitizers were used as the input device for many high-end CAD (computer aided design) systems as well as bundled with PCs and PC-based CAD software like AutoCAD.

MacPaint
An early commercial program that allowed users to design, draw, and manipulate objects was the program MacPaint. This program's first version was introduced on January 22, 1984, on the Apple Lisa. The ability to freehand draw and create graphics with this program made it the top program of its kind during 1984. The earlier versions of the program were called MacSketch and LisaSketch, and the last version of MacPaint was MacPaint 2.0 released in 1998.
Much of MacPaint's universal success was attributed to the release of the first Macintosh computer equipped with another program called MacWrite. It was the first personal computer with a graphical user interface and lost much of the bulky size of its predecessor, the Lisa. The Macintosh was available at about $2500 and the combination of a smaller design made the computer a hit, exposing the average computer user to the graphical possibilities of the included MacPaint.

Adobe
Another early image manipulation program was Adobe Photoshop. It was first called Display and was created in 1987 by Thomas Knoll at the University of Michigan as a monochrome picture display program. With help from his brother John, the program was turned into an image editing program called Imagepro but later changed to Photoshop. The Knolls agreed on a deal with Adobe Systems and Apple, and Photoshop 1.0 was released in 1991 for Macintosh. Adobe Systems had previously released Adobe Illustrator 1.0 in 1986 on the Apple Macintosh. These two programs, Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator are currently two of the top programs used to produce digital paintings. Illustrator introduced the uses of Bezier curves, which allowed the user to be incredibly detailed in their vector drawings.

Kid Pix
In 1988, Craig Hickman created a paint program called Kid Pix, which made it easier for children to create digital art. The program was created in black in white and after several revisions, was released in color in 1991. Kid Pix was one of the first commercial programs to integrate color and sound in a creative format. While the Kid Pix was intentionally created for children, it became a useful tool for introducing adults to the computer as well.

Corel Painter
Corel Painter was created in 1991 by Mark Zimmer and Tom Hedges of Fractal Design.

Krita
Krita is a free and open-source raster graphics editor designed primarily for digital art and 2D animation. Early development of the project can be tracked back to 1998. In 2009, the software increased its focus on digital painting, for a target audience of cartoonists, illustrators and concept artists.

Web-based painting programs
In recent years there has been a growth in the websites supporting online painting. The user is still drawing digitally with the use of software: often the software is on the server of the website which is being used. However, with the emergence of HTML5, some programs now partly use the client's web browser to handle some processing. The range of tools and brushes can be more limited than free-standing software. Speed of response, quality of color, and the ability to save to a file or print are similar in either media.

Applications
Entertainment and film
In film production, digital painting is used for concept art, matte paintings and visual effects. Artists use these digital tools to design environments, characters and scenes that guide the visual development of the film. Matte painting, for example, allows the creation of realistic backgrounds and settings which a",Painting,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_painting,0,digital painting either physical painting made use digital electronics spray paint robotics within digital art fine art context pictorial art imagery made pixel computer screen mimic artwork traditional history painting illustration technological origin sketchpad earliest graphical manipulation program called sketchpad created ivan sutherland grad student mit sketchpad allowed user manipulate object cathoderay tube crt sketchpad eventually led creation rand tablet work grail project first tablet created early tablet digitizer like id intelligent digitizer bitpad commercially successful used cad computer aided design program modernday graphic tablet tool choice digital painter tablet idea using tablet communicate direction computer idea since rand research development company santa monica developed rand tablet used program digitizer popularized mids early commercial success id intelligent digitizer bitpad manufactured summagraphics corp digitizer used input device many highend cad computer aided design system well bundled pc pcbased cad software like autocad macpaint early commercial program allowed user design draw manipulate object program macpaint program first version introduced january apple lisa ability freehand draw create graphic program made top program kind earlier version program called macsketch lisasketch last version macpaint macpaint released much macpaints universal success attributed release first macintosh computer equipped another program called macwrite first personal computer graphical user interface lost much bulky size predecessor lisa macintosh available combination smaller design made computer hit exposing average computer user graphical possibility included macpaint adobe another early image manipulation program adobe photoshop first called display created thomas knoll university michigan monochrome picture display program help brother john program turned image editing program called imagepro later changed photoshop knoll agreed deal adobe system apple photoshop released macintosh adobe system previously released adobe illustrator apple macintosh two program adobe photoshop adobe illustrator currently two top program used produce digital painting illustrator introduced us bezier curve allowed user incredibly detailed vector drawing kid pix craig hickman created paint program called kid pix made easier child create digital art program created black white several revision released color kid pix one first commercial program integrate color sound creative format kid pix intentionally created child became useful tool introducing adult computer well corel painter corel painter created mark zimmer tom hedge fractal design krita krita free opensource raster graphic editor designed primarily digital art animation early development project tracked back software increased focus digital painting target audience cartoonist illustrator concept artist webbased painting program recent year growth website supporting online painting user still drawing digitally use software often software server website used however emergence html program partly use client web browser handle processing range tool brush limited freestanding software speed response quality color ability save file print similar either medium application entertainment film film production digital painting used concept art matte painting visual effect artist use digital tool design environment character scene guide visual development film matte painting example allows creation realistic background setting
City proper,"A city proper is the geographical area contained within city limits. The term proper is not exclusive to cities; it can describe the geographical area within the boundaries of any given locality. The United Nations defines the term as ""... the single political jurisdiction which contains the historical city centre.""
City proper is one of the three basic concepts used to define urban areas and populations. The other two are urban agglomeration, and the metropolitan area. In some countries, city limits that act as the demarcation for the city proper are drawn very wide, in some very narrow. This can be cause for recurring controversy.

Usage
In its strict sense, city proper is used as a technical term in demography, the statistical study of human populations. Under the title ""World Urbanization Prospects"", the United Nations issues every two years estimates and projections of the urban and rural populations of all countries of the world. The book defines the population of a city proper as ""the population living within the administrative boundaries of a city."" The book continues to say that ""city proper as defined by administrative boundaries may not include suburban areas where an important proportion of the population working or studying in the city lives."" 

In demography, city proper is one of the three basic concepts used to define urban areas and populations. The other two are urban agglomeration, and the metropolitan area. In addition, there are Census Statistical Areas and permutations thereof.
A United Nations University working paper titled ""Urban Settlement"" reviews the most commonly used data sources, and highlights the difficulties inherent in defining and measuring the size of urban versus rural populations. It says: ""The city proper is determined by legal and administrative criteria, and typically comprises only those geographical areas that are part of a legally defined, and often historically-established administrative unit. However, many urban areas have grown far beyond the limits of the city proper, necessitating other measures. An urban agglomeration is the de facto population contained within the contours of a contiguous territory inhabited at urban density levels without regard to administrative boundaries’. Urban agglomerations are thus determined by density: the agglomeration ends where the density of settlement drops below some critical threshold. A still more comprehensive concept is the metropolitan area.""
In short, there is no ""right"" manner to define a city or municipality; city proper is just one manner.

Etymology
The term is a combination of ""city"" in the sense of ""an incorporated administrative district"", and ""proper"" in the sense of ""strictly limited to a specified thing, place, or idea"" or ""strictly accurate"". In encyclopedias, the term ""city proper"" is often used as an example to illustrate the meaning of the word ""proper"" in the sense of ""tightly defined"".

Encarta
""narrowly identified, strictly identified and distinguished from something else"" – stayed in the suburbs, not the city proper
Merriam-Webster
""strictly limited to a specified thing, place, or idea 'the city proper;""
Dictionary.com
""in the strict sense of the word (usually used postpositively)"":- Is the school within Boston proper or in the suburbs?
The Free Dictionary
""Being within the strictly limited sense, as of a term designating something: the town proper, excluding the suburbs"".

Internationalization
Especially when translated from the English or back, ""city proper"" sometimes takes on different meanings in different parts of the world. Some languages have no equivalent.
The United Nations Demographic Yearbook is compiled using questionnaires dispatched annually to more than 230 national statistical offices. These questionnaires ask for the country-specific definition of urban areas, rural areas and city proper. In its glossary, the Yearbook defines ""city proper"" as ""a locality defined according to legal/political boundaries and an administratively recognized urban status that is usually characterized by some form of local government"". In its data however, the United Nations Demographic Yearbook affords the individual countries considerable leeway over the definition of ""city proper"". The table titled ""Population of capital cities and cities of 100 000 or more inhabitants"" provides several country-specific definitions for ""city proper"" that diverge from the provided definition:

Japan
""Except for Tokyo, all data refer to shi, a minor division which may include some scattered or rural population as well as an urban centre"". In Tokyo, ""data for city proper refer to 23 wards (ku) of the old city"".
Australia
""For all regions it is not possible to distinguish between 'city proper' and 'urban agglomeration' areas, therefore data has been included under 'city proper'"".

Desert varnish,"Desert varnish or rock varnish is an orange-yellow to black coating found on exposed rock surfaces in arid environments. Desert varnish is approximately one micrometer thick and exhibits nanometer-scale layering. Rock rust and desert patina are other terms which are also used for the condition, but less often.

Formation
Desert varnish forms only on physically stable rock surfaces that are no longer subject to frequent precipitation, fracturing or wind abrasion. The varnish is primarily composed of particles of clay along with oxides of iron and manganese.  There is also a host of trace elements and almost always some organic matter. The color of the varnish varies from shades of brown to black.
It has been suggested that desert varnish should be investigated as a potential candidate for a ""shadow biosphere"". However, a 2008 microscopy study posited that desert varnish has already been reproduced with chemistry not involving life in the lab, and that the main component is actually silica and not clay as previously thought. The study notes that desert varnish is an excellent fossilizer for microbes and indicator of water. Desert varnish appears to have been observed by rovers on Mars, and if examined may contain fossilized life from Mars's wet period.

Composition
Originally scientists thought that the varnish was made from substances drawn out of the rocks it coats.  Microscopic and microchemical observations, however, show that a major part of varnish is clay, which could only arrive by wind.  Clay, then, acts as a substrate to catch additional substances that chemically react together when the rock reaches high temperatures in the desert sun.  Wetting by dew is also important in the process.
An important characteristic of black desert varnish is that it has an unusually high concentration of manganese. Manganese is relatively rare in the Earth's crust, making up only 0.12% of its weight. In black desert varnish, however, manganese is 50 to 60 times more abundant. One proposal  for a mechanism of desert varnish formation is that it is caused by manganese-oxidizing microbes (mixotrophs) which are common in environments poor in organic nutrients. A micro-environment pH above 7.5 is inhospitable for manganese-concentrating microbes. In such conditions, orange varnishes develop, poor in manganese (Mn) but rich in iron (Fe). An alternative hypothesis for Mn/Fe fluctuation has been proposed that considers Mn-rich and Fe-rich varnishes to be related to humid and arid climates, respectively.

Even though it contains high concentrations of iron and manganese, there are no significant modern uses of desert varnish. However, some Native American peoples created petroglyphs by scraping or chipping away the dark varnish to expose the lighter rock beneath.
Desert varnish often obscures the identity of the underlying rock, and different rocks have varying abilities to accept and retain varnish. Limestones, for example,  typically do not have varnish because they are too water-soluble and therefore do not provide a stable surface for varnish to form. Shiny, dense and black varnishes form on basalt, fine quartzites and metamorphosed shales due to these rocks' relatively high resistance to weathering.
Its presence has been cited as a key factor in the preservation of a large number of petroglyphs dating back to the Iron Age and earlier in areas such as the Wadi Saham in the United Arab Emirates.

Marine lake,"A marine lake is a lake situated very close to the sea, which has a connection to this sea, via tunnels or cracks in the soil. Marine lakes are fed with seawater but are usually also fed with rainwater, meaning that the salt content of the water is usually lower. The measure of salt greatly depends on the size of the tunnel or crack connecting it to the sea.
Due to the specific level of salt in the water, and the fact that the lakes are so secluded, marine lakes house a large amount of unique species, often found nowhere else on the planet. Destruction of one such lake means that many species can become extinct with it.

Lakes around the world
There are about 200 known marine lakes. Most of these are located in Vietnam, Palau, and Indonesia. A notable marine lake is  Ongeim’l Tketau, in Palau, known for its vast numbers of jellyfish, to which it owes its nickname, Jellyfish Lake.

Threats
Marine lakes are vulnerable to threats from human activities and climate change. Common threats are:

introduction of non-endemic species
uncontrolled development of tourism
use as fishponds to store recent catch or to cultivate captured fish
use as public toilets

Lake of fire,"The lake of fire is a concept that appears in both the ancient Egyptian and Christian religions. In ancient Egypt, it appears as an obstacle on the journey through the underworld which can destroy or refresh the deceased. In Christianity, it is a concept of after-death punishment of the wicked. The phrase is used in five verses of the Book of Revelation. In the biblical context, the concept seems similar to the Jewish Gehenna. The image of the lake of fire was taken up by the early Christian Hippolytus of Rome in about the year 230 and has continued to be used by modern Christians.

Ancient Egyptian religion
Fiery rivers and lakes in the underworld are mentioned in works such as the Coffin Texts and the Egyptian Book of the Dead. Around their edges sit flaming braziers or baboons. Ra would pass through this lake on his journey through the Duat, renewing his boat. Chapter 126 of the Egyptian Book of the Dead is associated with this vignette and the text is addressed to the ""four baboons who sit in the prow of the Barque of Re."" The lake was one of the dangers encountered on the journey through the Duat and had a dual nature. The baboons who guarded the pool were a force that could refresh and protect the deceased if they knew the correct recitation or destroy them if they did not. In the 21st Dynasty, human figures are depicted within the lakes. These represent enemies of the king or gods and their inclusion within the pools ensures their permanent destruction. In this way, the deceased could avoid meeting a similar fate, and be victorious over the forces of chaos like Ra. Am-heh, whose name means ""devourer of millions"" or ""eater of eternity"", is a hunting dog headed god from the underworld who lived in a lake of fire.

Christianity
Book of Revelation
The Book of Revelation has five verses that mention a ""lake of fire"" (Ancient Greek: λίμνη τοῦ πυρός, romanized: limne tou pyros):

And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.
And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.
Then Death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And anyone not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire.
But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the detestable, as for murderers, the sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, their portion will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death.

A traditional interpretation is that the ""lake of fire"" is symbolic of the pain of being separated from God, as punishment for wickedness. The Greek words translated ""torment"" or ""tormented"" in English come from the root βάσανος, basanos with the original meaning of ""the testing of gold and silver as a medium of exchange by the proving stone"" and a later connotation of a person, especially a slave, ""severely tested by torture"" to reveal truth. It can also have a connotation of restraint.

Denominational views
Anabaptism
Anabaptist Christians distinguish between the intermediate state that one enters after death, and the final state after the Last Judgment:

ARTICLE XVIL OF THE INTERMEDIATE STATE: We believe that in the interval between death and resurrection, the righteous will be with Christ in a state of conscious bliss and comfort, but that the wicked will be in a place of torment, in a state of conscious suffering and despair. Lu. 16:19–31; 23:43; Phil. 1:23; II Cor. 5:1–8; I Thes. 5:10; II Pet. 2:9 (R.V.). 

ARTICLE XVII. OF THE FINAL STATE: We believe that hell is the place of torment, prepared for the devil and his angels, where with them the wicked will suffer the vengeance of eternal fire forever and ever and that heaven is the final abode of the righteous, where they will dwell in the fullness of joy forever and ever. Matt. 25:41, 46; Jude 7; Rev. 14:8–11; 20:10, 15; II Cor. 5:21; Rev. 21:3–8; 22:1–5. —1921 Garden City Confession of Faith (Mennonite Anabaptist)

Restorationism
Jehovah's Witnesses interpret the ""lake of fire"" and ""second death"" of the Book of Revelation as referring to a symbol, not a literal lake, of a complete and definitive annihilation of those cast into it.
Seventh-day Adventists believe in annihilation as well. They too believe that the lake of fire passage is referring to extinction, not to eternal torment.
Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and other churches within the Latter Day Saint Movement read of a concept of the ""lake of fire"" in the Book of Mormon in several passages. The most descriptive instance of a ""lake of fire"" in the Book of Mormon occurs in Jacob 6:10, which reads, ""Ye must go away into that lake of fire and brimstone, whose flames are unque",Lakes,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_of_fire,1,lake fire concept appears ancient egyptian christian religion ancient egypt appears obstacle journey underworld destroy refresh deceased christianity concept afterdeath punishment wicked phrase used five verse book revelation biblical context concept seems similar jewish gehenna image lake fire taken early christian hippolytus rome year continued used modern christian ancient egyptian religion fiery river lake underworld mentioned work coffin text egyptian book dead around edge sit flaming brazier baboon ra would pas lake journey duat renewing boat chapter egyptian book dead associated vignette text addressed four baboon sit prow barque lake one danger encountered journey duat dual nature baboon guarded pool force could refresh protect deceased knew correct recitation destroy st dynasty human figure depicted within lake represent enemy king god inclusion within pool ensures permanent destruction way deceased could avoid meeting similar fate victorious force chaos like ra amheh whose name mean devourer million eater eternity hunting dog headed god underworld lived lake fire christianity book revelation book revelation five verse mention lake fire ancient greek λίμνη τοῦ πυρός romanized limne tou pyros beast taken false prophet wrought miracle deceived received mark beast worshipped image cast alive lake fire burning brimstone devil deceived cast lake fire brimstone beast false prophet shall tormented day night ever ever death hades cast lake fire second death anyone found written book life cast lake fire cowardly faithless detestable murderer sexually immoral sorcerer idolater liar portion lake burn fire sulfur second death traditional interpretation lake fire symbolic pain separated god punishment wickedness greek word translated torment tormented english come root βάσανος basanos original meaning testing gold silver medium exchange proving stone later connotation person especially slave severely tested torture reveal truth also connotation restraint denominational view anabaptism anabaptist christian distinguish intermediate state one enters death final state last judgment article xvil intermediate state believe interval death resurrection righteous christ state conscious bliss comfort wicked place torment state conscious suffering despair lu – phil ii cor – thes ii pet rv article xvii final state believe hell place torment prepared devil angel wicked suffer vengeance eternal fire forever ever heaven final abode righteous dwell fullness joy forever ever matt jude rev – ii cor rev – – — garden city confession faith mennonite anabaptist restorationism jehovah witness interpret lake fire second death book revelation referring symbol literal lake complete definitive annihilation cast seventhday adventist believe annihilation well believe lake fire passage referring extinction eternal torment member church jesus christ latterday saint church within latter day saint movement read concept lake fire book mormon several passage descriptive instance lake fire book mormon occurs jacob read ye must go away lake fire brimstone whose flame unque
Aeolian processes,"Aeolian processes, also spelled eolian, pertain to wind activity in the study of geology and weather and specifically to the wind's ability to shape the surface of the Earth (or other planets).  Winds may erode, transport, and deposit materials. They are effective agents in regions with sparse vegetation, a lack of soil moisture and a large supply of unconsolidated sediments. Although water is a much more powerful eroding force than wind, aeolian processes are important in arid environments such as deserts.
The term is derived from the name of the Greek god Aeolus, the keeper of the winds.

Definition and setting
Aeolian processes are those processes of erosion, transport, and deposition of sediments that are caused by wind at or near the surface of the earth. Sediment deposits produced by the action of wind and the sedimentary structures characteristic of these deposits are also described as aeolian.
Aeolian processes are most important in areas where there is little or no vegetation. However, aeolian deposits are not restricted to arid climates. They are also seen along shorelines; along stream courses in semiarid climates; in areas of ample sand weathered from weakly cemented sandstone outcrops; and in areas of glacial outwash.
Loess, which is silt deposited by wind, is common in humid to subhumid climates. Much of North America and Europe are underlain by sand and loess of Pleistocene age originating from glacial outwash.
The lee (downwind) side of river valleys in semiarid regions are often blanketed with sand and sand dunes. Examples in North America include the Platte, Arkansas, and Missouri Rivers.

Wind erosion
Wind erodes the Earth's surface by deflation (the removal of loose, fine-grained particles by the turbulent action of the wind) and by abrasion (the wearing down of surfaces by the grinding action and sandblasting by windborne particles). Once entrained in the wind, collisions between particles further break them down, a process called attrition.
Worldwide, erosion by water is more important than erosion by wind, but wind erosion is important in semiarid and arid regions. Wind erosion is increased by some human activities, such as the use of 4x4 vehicles.

Deflation
Deflation is the lifting and removal of loose material from the surface by wind turbulence. It takes place by three mechanisms: traction/surface creep, saltation, and suspension. Traction or surface creep is a process of larger grains sliding or rolling across the surface. Saltation refers to particles bouncing across the surface for short distances. Suspended particles are fully entrained in the wind, which carries them for long distances. Saltation likely accounts for 50–70 % of deflation, while suspension accounts for 30–40 % and surface creep accounts for 5–25 %.
Regions which experience intense and sustained erosion are called deflation zones. Most aeolian deflation zones are composed of desert pavement, a sheet-like surface of rock fragments that remains after wind and water have removed the fine particles. The rock mantle in desert pavements protects the underlying material from further deflation. Areas of desert pavement form the regs or stony deserts of the Sahara. These are further divided into rocky areas called hamadas and areas of small rocks and gravel called serirs. Desert pavement is extremely common in desert environments.
Blowouts are hollows formed by wind deflation. Blowouts are generally small, but may be up to several kilometers in diameter. The smallest are mere dimples 0.3 meters (1 ft) deep and 3 meters (10 ft) in diameter. The largest include the blowout hollows of Mongolia, which can be 8 kilometers (5 mi) across and 60 to 100 meters (200 to 400 ft) deep. Big Hollow in Wyoming, US, extends 14 by 9.7 kilometers (9 by 6 mi) and is up to 90 meters (300 ft) deep.

Abrasion
Abrasion (also sometimes called corrasion) is the process of wind-driven grains knocking or wearing material off of landforms. It was once considered a major contributor to desert erosion, but by the mid-20th Century, it had come to be considered much less important. Wind can normally lift sand only a short distance, with most windborne sand remaining within 50 centimeters (20 in) of the surface and practically none normally being carried above 2 meters (6 ft). Many desert features once attributed to wind abrasion, including wind caves, mushroom rocks, and the honeycomb weathering called tafoni, are now attributed to differential weathering, rainwash, deflation rather than abrasion, or other processes.
Yardangs are one kind of desert feature that is widely attributed to wind abrasion. These are rock ridges, up to tens of meters high and kilometers long, that have been streamlined by desert winds. Yardangs characteristically show elongated furrows or grooves aligned with the prevailing wind. They form mostly in softer material such as silts.
Abrasion produces polishing and pitting, grooving, shaping, and faceting of exposed surfaces.

Chemical biology,"Chemical biology is a scientific discipline between the fields of chemistry and biology. The discipline involves the application of chemical techniques, analysis, and often small molecules produced through synthetic chemistry, to the study and manipulation of biological systems. Although often confused with biochemistry, which studies the chemistry of biomolecules and regulation of biochemical pathways within and between cells, chemical biology remains distinct by focusing on the application of chemical tools to address biological questions.

History
Although considered a relatively new scientific field, the term ""chemical biology"" has been in use since the early 20th century, and has roots in scientific discovery from the early 19th century. The term 'chemical biology' can be traced back to an early appearance in a book published by Alonzo E. Taylor in 1907 titled ""On Fermentation"", and was subsequently used in John B. Leathes' 1930 article titled ""The Harveian Oration on The Birth of Chemical Biology"". However, it is unclear when the term was first used.
Friedrich Wöhler's 1828 synthesis of urea is an early example of the application of synthetic chemistry to advance biology. It showed that biological compounds could be synthesized with inorganic starting materials and weakened the previous notion of vitalism, or that a 'living' source was required to produce organic compounds. Wöhler's work is often considered to be instrumental in the development of organic chemistry and natural product synthesis, both of which play a large part in modern chemical biology.
Friedrich Miescher's work during the late 19th century investigating the cellular contents of human leukocytes led to the discovery of 'nuclein', which would later be renamed DNA. After isolating the nuclein from the nucleus of leukocytes through protease digestion, Miescher used chemical techniques such as elemental analysis and solubility tests to determine the composition of nuclein. This work would lay the foundations for Watson and Crick's discovery of the double-helix structure of DNA.
The rising interest in chemical biology has led to several journals dedicated to the field. Nature Chemical Biology, created in 2005, and ACS Chemical Biology, created in 2006, are two of the most well-known journals in this field, with impact factors of 14.8 and 4.0 respectively.

Research areas
Glycobiology
Glycobiology is the study of the structure and function of carbohydrates. While DNA, RNA, and proteins are encoded at the genetic level, carbohydrates are not encoded directly from the genome, and thus require different tools for their study. By applying chemical principles to glycobiology, novel methods for analyzing and synthesizing carbohydrates can be developed. For example, cells can be supplied with synthetic variants of natural sugars to probe their function. Carolyn Bertozzi's research group has developed methods for site-specifically reacting molecules at the surface of cells via synthetic sugars.

Combinatorial chemistry
Combinatorial chemistry involves simultaneously synthesizing a large number of related compounds for high-throughput analysis. Chemical biologists are able to use principles from combinatorial chemistry in synthesizing active drug compounds and maximizing screening efficiency. Similarly, these principles can be used in areas of agriculture and food research, specifically in the syntheses of unnatural products and in generating novel enzyme inhibitors.

Peptide synthesis
Chemical synthesis of proteins is a valuable tool in chemical biology as it allows for the introduction of non-natural amino acids as well as residue-specific incorporation of ""posttranslational modifications"" such as phosphorylation, glycosylation, acetylation, and even ubiquitination. These properties are valuable for chemical biologists as non-natural amino acids can be used to probe and alter the functionality of proteins, while post-translational modifications are widely known to regulate the structure and activity of proteins. Although strictly biological techniques have been developed to achieve these ends, the chemical synthesis of peptides often has a lower technical and practical barrier to obtaining small amounts of the desired protein.
To make protein-sized polypeptide chains with the small peptide fragments made by synthesis, chemical biologists can use the process of native chemical ligation. Native chemical ligation involves the coupling of a C-terminal thioester and an N-terminal cysteine residue, ultimately resulting in formation of a ""native"" amide bond. Other strategies that have been used for the ligation of peptide fragments using the acyl transfer chemistry first introduced with native chemical ligation include expressed protein ligation, sulfurization/desulfurization techniques, and use of removable thiol auxiliaries.

Internet geography,"Internet geography, also called cybergeography, is a subdiscipline of geography that studies the spatial organization of the Internet from social, economic, cultural, and technological perspectives. 
The core assumption of Internet geography is that the location of servers, websites, data, services, and infrastructure is key to understand the development and the dynamics of the Internet. For instance, the Internet's topology may be mapped by determining how fast data is transmitted between points using methods such as ping.
One topic covered by this discipline is information geography. For instance, programs that connect to the Internet, such as search engines and social media applications, enable users to sort and view the mass of information within the Internet.
Another topic that Internet geography examines is the digital divides.

Mayan cities,"Maya cities were the centres of population of the pre-Columbian Maya civilization of Mesoamerica. They served the specialised roles of administration, commerce, manufacturing and religion that characterised ancient cities worldwide. Maya cities tended to be more dispersed than cities in other societies, even within Mesoamerica, as a result of adaptation to a lowland tropical environment that allowed food production amidst areas dedicated to other activities. They lacked the grid plans of the highland cities of central Mexico, such as Teotihuacán and Tenochtitlan. Maya monarchs ruled their kingdoms from palaces that were situated within the centre of their cities. Cities tended to be located in places that controlled trade routes or that could supply essential products. This allowed the elites that controlled trade to increase their wealth and status. Such cities were able to construct temples for public ceremonies, thus attracting further inhabitants to the city. Those cities that had favourable conditions for food production, combined with access to trade routes, were likely to develop into the capital cities of early Maya states.
The political relationship between Classic Maya city-states has been likened to the relationships between city-states in Classical Greece and Renaissance Italy. Some cities were linked to each other by straight limestone causeways, known as sacbeob, although whether the exact function of these roads was commercial, political or religious has not been determined.

Architectural organization
Maya cities were not formally planned like the cities of highland Mexico and were subject to irregular expansion, with the haphazard addition to all of the palaces, temples and other buildings. Most Maya cities tended to grow outwards from the core, and upwards as new structures were superimposed upon preceding architecture. Maya cities usually had a ceremonial and administrative centre surrounded by a vast irregular sprawl of residential complexes. The centres of all Maya cities featured sacred precincts, sometimes separated from nearby residential areas by walls. These precincts contained pyramid temples and other monumental architecture dedicated to elite activities, such as basal platforms that supported administrative or elite residential complexes. Sculpted monuments were raised to record the deeds of the ruling dynasty. City centres also featured plazas, sacred ballcourts and buildings used for marketplaces and schools. Frequently causeways linked the centre to outlying areas of the city. Some of these classes of architecture formed lesser groups in the outlying areas of the city, which served as sacred centres for non-royal lineages. The areas adjacent to these sacred compounds included residential complexes housing wealthy lineages. Art excavated from these elite residential complexes varies in quality according to the rank and prestige of the lineage that it housed. The largest and richest of these elite compounds sometimes possessed sculpture and art of craftsmanship equal to that of royal art.
The ceremonial centre of the Maya city was where the ruling elite lived, and where the administrative functions of the city were performed, together with religious ceremonies. It was also where the inhabitants of the city gathered for public activities. Elite residential complexes occupied the best land around the city centre, while commoners had their residences dispersed further away from the ceremonial centre. Residential units were built on top of stone platforms to raise them above the level of the rain season floodwaters.

Population estimates
Until the 1960s, scholarly opinion was that the ruins of Maya centres were not true cities but were rather empty ceremonial centres where the priesthood performed religious rituals for the peasant farmers, who lived dispersed in the middle of the jungle. Since the 1960s, formal archaeological mapping projects have revealed that the ceremonial centres in fact formed the centres of dispersed cities that possessed populations that at some sites could reach tens of thousands.

History
Middle Preclassic Period
During the Middle Preclassic Period (1000-400 BC), small villages began to grow to form cities. Aguada Fenix in Tabasco, Mexico is the oldest Maya city known, the site was built in 1000 BC, it is thought to have been built by communal labor, an early form of social organization and development where it is believed that many tribes decided to establish a major settlement marking the beginnings of the Maya civilization. Aguada Fenix includes early monumental buildings and the oldest and biggest Maya structure by volume with 1400 meters long, 400 meters wide and 15 meters high. Aguada Fenix was abandoned around the year 750 BC for unknown reasons, after this, several sites started to flourish along the Maya Lowlands. By 500 BC these cities possessed large temple structures decorated with stucco masks representing gods.

Binder (material),"A binder or binding agent is any material or substance that holds or draws other materials together to form a cohesive whole mechanically, chemically, by adhesion or cohesion.
More narrowly, binders are liquid or dough-like substances that harden by a chemical or physical process and bind fibres, filler powder and other particles added into it. Examples include glue, adhesive and thickening.
Examples of mechanical binders are bond stones in masonry and tie beams in timber framing.

Classification
Binders are loosely classified as organic (bitums, animal and plant glues, polymers) and inorganic (lime, cement, gypsum, liquid glass, etc.). These can be either metallic or ceramic as well as polymeric depending on the nature of the main material. For example, in the compound WC-Co (Tungsten Carbide used in cutting tools) Co constitutes the binding agent for the WC particles.
Based on their chemical resistance, binders are classified by the field of use: non-hydraulic (gypsum, air-cements, magnesia, hydrated lime), hydraulic (Roman cement, portland cement, hydraulic lime), acid-resistant (silicon fluoride cement, quartz cement), and autoclavable (harden at 170 to 300°С i.e. 8-16 atm pressure and, e.g., comprise CaSiO3 materials).

Physical properties
Some materials labeled as binders such as cement have a high compressive strength but low tensile strength and need to be reinforced with fibrous material or rebar if tension and shear forces will be applied.
Other binding agents such as resins may be tough and possibly elastic but can neither bear compressive nor tensile force. Tensile strength is greatly improved in composite materials consisting of resin as the matrix and fiber as a reinforcement. Compressive strength can be improved by adding filling material.

Uses
Binders hold together pigments and sometimes filling material to form paints, pastels, and other materials used for artistic and utilitarian painting. Materials include wax, linseed oil, natural gums such as gum arabic or gum tragacanth, methyl cellulose, or proteins such as egg white or casein. Glue is traditionally made by the boiling of hoofs, bones, or skin of animals and then mixing the hard gelatinous residue with water. Natural gum-based binders are made from substances extracted from plants. Larger amounts of dry substance are added to liquid binders in order to cast or model sculptures and reliefs.
In cooking, various edible thickening agents are used as binders. Some of them, e.g. tapioca flour, lactose, sucrose, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone and various starches are also used in pharmacology in making tablets. Tablet binders include lactose powder, sucrose powder, tapioca starch (cassava flour) and microcrystalline cellulose.
In building construction, concrete uses cement as a binder.  Asphalt pavement uses bitumen binder. Traditionally straw and natural fibres are used to strengthen clay in wattle-and-daub construction and in the building material cob which would otherwise become brittle after drying. Sand is added to improve compressive strength, hardness and reduce shrinkage. The binding property of clay is also used widely to prepare shaped articles (e.g. pots and vases) or to bind solid pieces (e.g. bricks).
In composite materials, epoxy, polyester or phenolic resins are common. In reinforced carbon–carbon, plastic or pitch resin is used as a source of carbon released through pyrolysis. Transite, hypertufa, papercrete and petecrete used cement as a binder.
In explosives, wax or polymers like polyisobutylene or styrene-butadiene rubber are often used as binders for plastic explosives. For polymer-bonded explosives, various synthetic polymers are used.
In rocket fuels, polybutadiene acrylonitrile copolymer was used in 1960-70's big solid-fuel booster rocket fuels.
Organic binders, designed to disintegrate by heat during baking, are used in sintering.

History
In the Classical World painters used materials like egg, wax, honey, lime, casein, linseed oil or bitumen as binders to mix with pigment in order to hold the pigment particles together in the formation of paint. Egg-based tempera was especially popular in Europe from the Middle Ages until the early 16th century. However, since that time, the binder of choice for paint has been oil.

Mountain breeze and valley breeze,"In meteorology, a mountain breeze and a valley breeze are two related, localized winds that occur one after the other on a daily cycle. They are an example of anabatic and katabatic winds occurring at local scales. These winds are opposite from each other. Mountain winds blow from mountain towards valley after sunset, when mountain cools down and valley zone is comparatively warmer. While valley breezes occur when the warm air rises up the sides of the valley, warm air in a mountain breeze will rise up the middle.

Cause

Mountain and valley breezes form through a process similar to sea and land breezes. During the day, the sun heats up mountain air rapidly while the valley remains relatively cooler. Convection causes it to rise, causing a valley breeze. At night, the process is reversed. During the night the slopes get cooled and the dense air descends into the valley as the mountain wind. These breezes occur mostly during calm and clear weather. Mountain and valley breezes are other examples of local winds caused by an area's geography. Campers in mountainous areas may feel a warm afternoon quickly change into a cold night soon after the sun sets. During the day, the sun warms the air along the mountain slopes. This warm air rises up the mountain slopes, creating a valley breeze. At nightfall, the air along the mountain slopes cools. This cool air moves down the slopes into the valley, producing a mountain breeze.

Edge states,"In solid state physics, edge states are the topologically protected electronic states that exist at the boundary of the material and cannot be removed without breaking the system's symmetry.

Background

The electronic band structure of materials is primarily studied based on the extent of the band gap, the gap between highest occupied valence bands and lowest unoccupied conduction bands. The possible energy level of the material that provides the discrete energy values of all possible states in the energy profile diagram can be represented by solving the Hamiltonian of the system. This solution provides the corresponding energy eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Based on the energy eigenvalues, conduction band are the high energy states (energy E > 0) while valence bands are the low energy states (E < 0). In some materials, for example, in graphene and zigzag graphene quantum dot, there exists the energy states having energy eigenvalues exactly equal to zero (E = 0) besides the conduction and valence bands. These states are called edge states which modifies the electronic and optical properties of the materials significantly.

Animal Logic,"Animal Logic (also known as Animal Logic VFX) is an Australian visual effects and computer animation digital studio based at Disney Studios in Sydney, New South Wales in Australia, Vancouver in Canada, and Rideback Ranch in Los Angeles, California. Established in 1991, Animal Logic has produced visual effects and animation for feature films such as the Academy Award-winning Happy Feet, Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole, Walking with Dinosaurs 3D, The Lego Movie and Peter Rabbit. The company was also recognized for its work as lead visual effects vendor on Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby, which won Outstanding Achievement in Visual Effects at the 3rd AACTA Awards ceremony. In 2018, Peter Rabbit was presented with a range of accolades, including the AACTA Award for Best Visual Effects or Animation, and Australian Production Design Guild Awards (APDG) in Visual Effects Design and Drawing, Concept Illustration & Concept Models for Screen. Most recently, the company has produced work for the Warner Animation Group's The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part and Marvel Studios' Captain Marvel. It is a subsidiary of Netflix, and then solds it and the company was split in two, and the animation department acquired by Netflix. The new company was named Netflix Animation Studios in Sydney and Vancouver.
Initially, Animal Logic's core business was the design and production of high-end visual effects for commercials and television programs, and early success within these fields provided a platform for expansion into feature film work. Animal Logic went on to produce visual effects for various large budget feature film projects, including Babe, Babe: Pig in the City, The Matrix, Moulin Rouge!, Hero, House of Flying Daggers, Planet of the Apes, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, World Trade Center, Fool's Gold, 300, Knowing, Australia, Sucker Punch, and The Great Gatsby.

History
In 1991, Zareh Nalbandian and Chris Godfrey formed and founded a digital studio in Crows Nest, Sydney, Australia. The company was born out of Video Paint Brush Company, which Nalbandian, who had worked there for a few years, and his colleague Godfrey acquired in a management buy-out and renamed Animal Logic.
Animal Logic moved to Fox Studios Australia in Moore Park, Sydney, in 1998. In 2003, Animal Logic began work on its first computer-animated feature film, Happy Feet, for director George Miller. Released in the United States on 17 November 2006, the project saw the company expand significantly, recruiting up to 300 artists and technicians from Australia and around the world. Happy Feet, which was the first computer-animated feature film produced in Australia, went on to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature as well as the new BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film.
Their full-length feature animation, Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole, was released on 24 September 2010 and was Australia's first animated feature to be released in 3D. From 2004 to 2007, the company produced bumpers for Cartoon Network. In 2011, the company produced and animated LEGO Star Wars: The Padawan Menace, a 30-minute TV special. Produced for Lucasfilm and Cartoon Network, the special premiered in the United States on Cartoon Network and was followed by a worldwide DVD and Blu-ray release. In 2012, Animal Logic acquired the assets of fellow Australian visual effects studio Fuel VFX, known for their work on feature films such as Iron Man 3, Prometheus, The Avengers, Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol, Cowboys & Aliens, Captain America: The First Avenger and Thor. Fuel VFX was nominated for a Visual Effects Society Award and a BAFTA Award for Best Special Visual Effects for their work on Prometheus. 2012 also saw the release of the Animal Logic-animated ""Polar Bowl"" campaign, consisting of a 60-second and two 30-second commercials that aired at halftime at the Super Bowl XLVI. The campaign aimed to re-launch the iconic Coca-Cola polar bear characters to a new generation. Following the success of the 3 spots, which were viewed by over 160 million people globally, the company went on to animate a 6-minute short film directed by John Stevenson to headline Coca-Cola's 2013 global campaign. The film was first released through YouTube in December 2012, followed by a worldwide international theater release. In 2013, the company led visual effects and animation work on BBC Earth and Evergreen Films' 3D live-action feature Walking with Dinosaurs 3D,
In 2014, Animal Logic provided animation services for the 2014 film The Lego Movie, which was produced by the Warner Animation Group and directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller. After the film's huge success, the company was split into three subsidiaries operating under the Animal Logic's group:  Animal Logic VFX, Animal Logic Animation, and Animal Logic Entertainment, a Los Angeles-based arm tasked with developing VFX, animation and hybrid feature films for the company.

Gendarme (mountaineering),"A gendarme is a pinnacle of rock on a mountain ridge. They are typical of alpine areas. Gendarmes often form on the intersection of two ridges due to the lower erosion of glaciers here.  The name originates from the French Alps, where they were seen as resembling the gendarmerie police.

Mixed layer,"The oceanic or limnological mixed layer is a layer in which active turbulence has homogenized some range of depths. The surface mixed layer is a layer where this turbulence is generated by winds, surface heat fluxes, or processes such as evaporation or sea ice formation which result in an increase in salinity.   The atmospheric mixed layer is a zone having nearly constant potential temperature and specific humidity with height. The depth of the atmospheric mixed layer is known as the mixing height.  Turbulence typically plays a role in the formation of fluid mixed layers.

Oceanic mixed layer
Importance of the mixed layer
The mixed layer plays an important role in the physical climate. Because the specific heat of ocean water is much larger than that of air, the top 2.5 m of the ocean holds as much heat as the entire atmosphere above it. Thus the heat required to change a mixed layer of 2.5 m by 1 °C would be sufficient to raise the temperature of the atmosphere by 1 °C. The depth of the mixed layer is thus very important for determining the temperature range in oceanic and coastal regions.   In addition, the heat stored within the oceanic mixed layer provides a source for heat that drives global variability such as El Niño.
The mixed layer is also important as its depth determines the average level of light seen by marine organisms. In very deep mixed layers, the tiny marine organisms known as phytoplankton are unable to get enough light to maintain their metabolism. The deepening of the mixed layer in the wintertime in the North Atlantic is therefore associated with a strong decrease in surface chlorophyll a. However, this deep mixing also replenishes near-surface nutrient stocks. Thus when the mixed layer becomes shallow in the spring, and light levels increase,  there is often a concomitant increase of phytoplankton biomass, known as the ""spring bloom"".

Oceanic mixed layer formation
There are three primary sources of energy for driving turbulent mixing within the open-ocean mixed layer.  The first is the ocean waves, which act in two ways. The first is the generation of turbulence near the ocean surface, which acts to stir light water downwards. Although this process injects a great deal of energy into the upper few meters, most of it dissipates relatively rapidly. If ocean currents vary with depth, waves can interact with them to drive the process known as Langmuir circulation, large eddies that stir down to depths of tens of meters.  The second is wind-driven currents, which create layers in which there are velocity shears. When these shears reach sufficient magnitude, they can eat into stratified fluid. This process is often described and modelled as an example of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, though other processes may play a role as well. Finally, if cooling, addition of brine from freezing sea ice, or evaporation at the surface causes the surface density to increase, convection will occur. The deepest mixed layers (exceeding 2000 m in regions such as the Labrador Sea) are formed through this final process, which is a form of Rayleigh–Taylor instability. Early models of the mixed layer such as those of Mellor and Durbin included the final two processes. In coastal zones, large velocities due to tides may also play an important role in establishing the mixed layer.
The mixed layer is characterized by being nearly uniform in properties such as temperature and salinity throughout the layer. Velocities, however, may exhibit significant shears within the mixed layer. The bottom of the mixed layer is characterized by a gradient, where the water properties change.   Oceanographers use various definitions of the number to use as the mixed layer depth at any given time, based on making measurements of physical properties of the water.  Often, an abrupt temperature change called a thermocline occurs to mark the bottom of the mixed layer; sometimes there may be an abrupt salinity change called a halocline that occurs as well.  The combined influence of temperature and salinity changes results in an abrupt density change, or pycnocline. Additionally, sharp gradients in nutrients (nutricline) and oxygen (oxycline) and a maximum in chlorophyll concentration are often co-located with the base of the seasonal mixed layer.

Oceanic mixed layer depth determination
The depth of the mixed layer is often determined by hydrography—making measurements of water properties. Two criteria often used to determine the mixed layer depth are temperature and sigma-t (density) change from a reference value (usually the surface measurement).  The temperature criterion used in Levitus (1982) defines the mixed layer as the depth at which the temperature change from the surface temperature is 0.5 °C. However, work done by Kara et. al. (2000) suggest that the temperature difference is closer to .8  °C. The sigma-t (density) criterion used in Levitus uses the depth at which a change from the surface sigma-t of 0.125 has occurred.

Loch,"Loch ( LOKH) is a word meaning ""lake"" or ""sea inlet"" in Scottish and Irish Gaelic, subsequently borrowed into English. In Irish contexts, it often appears in the anglicized form ""lough"". A small loch is sometimes called a lochan. Lochs which connect to the sea may be called ""sea lochs"" or ""sea loughs"".

Background
This name for a body of water is Insular Celtic in origin and is applied to most lakes in Scotland and to many sea inlets in the west and north of Scotland.
Many of the loughs in Northern England have also previously been called ""meres"" (a Northern English dialect word for ""lake"", and an archaic Standard English word meaning ""a lake that is broad in relation to its depth""), similar to the Dutch meer, such as the Black Lough in Northumberland.  
Some lochs in Southern Scotland have a Brythonic, rather than Goidelic, etymology, such as Loch Ryan, where the Gaelic loch has replaced a Cumbric equivalent of Welsh llwch. The same is, perhaps, the case for bodies of water in Northern England named with 'Low' or 'Lough', or else represents a borrowing of the Brythonic word into the Northumbrian dialect of Old English.

Scottish lakes
Scotland has very few bodies of water called lakes. The Lake of Menteith, an Anglicisation of the Scots Laich o Menteith meaning a ""low-lying bit of land in Menteith"", is applied to the loch there because of the similarity of the sounds of the words laich and lake. Until the 19th century the body of water was known as the Loch of Menteith.  The Lake of the Hirsel, Pressmennan Lake, Lake Louise and Raith Lake are man-made bodies of water in Scotland, referred to as lakes.

Lochs outside Scotland and Ireland
As ""loch"" is a common Gaelic word, it is found as the root of several Manx place names.
The United States naval port of Pearl Harbor, on the south coast of the main Hawaiian island of Oʻahu, is one of a complex of sea inlets. It contains three subareas called 'lochs' named East, Middle, and West or Kaihuopala‘ai, Wai‘awa, and Komoawa.
Loch Raven Reservoir is a reservoir in Baltimore County, Maryland.
Brenton Loch in the Falkland Islands is a sea loch, near Lafonia, East Falkland.
In the Scottish settlement of Glengarry County in present-day Eastern Ontario, there is a lake called Loch Garry. Loch Garry was named by those who settled in the area, Clan MacDonell of Glengarry, after the well-known loch their clan is from, Loch Garry in Scotland. Similarly, lakes named Loch Broom, Big Loch, Greendale Loch, and Loch Lomond can be found in Nova Scotia, along with Loch Leven in Newfoundland, and Loch Leven in Saskatchewan.
Loch Fyne is a fjord in Greenland named by Douglas Clavering in 1823.

Indo-Pacific,"The Indo-Pacific is a vast biogeographic region of Earth. In a narrow sense, sometimes known as the Indo-West Pacific or Indo-Pacific Asia, it comprises the tropical waters of the Indian Ocean, the western and central Pacific Ocean, and the seas connecting the two. The term is especially useful in marine biology, ichthyology, and similar fields, since many marine habitats are continuously connected from Madagascar to Japan and Oceania, and a number of species occur over that range, but are not found in the Atlantic Ocean.
As a distinct marine realm, the region has an exceptionally high species richness, with the world's highest species richness being found in at its heart in the Coral Triangle, and a remarkable gradient of decreasing species richness radiating outward in all directions. The region includes over 3,000 species of fish, compared with around 1,200 in the next richest marine region, the Western Atlantic, and around 500 species of reef building corals, compared with about 50 species in the Western Atlantic. 
The term first appeared in academic use in oceanography and geopolitics. Scholarship has shown that the ""Indo-Pacific"" concept circulated in Weimar Germany, and spread to interwar Japan. German political oceanographers envisioned an ""Indo-Pacific"" comprising anticolonial India and republican China, as German allies, against ""Euro-America"". Since the late 2010s, the term ""Indo-Pacific"" has been increasingly used in geopolitical discourse. It has a ""symbiotic link"" with the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or ""Quad"", an informal grouping between Australia, Japan, India, and the United States. It has been argued that the concept may lead to a change in popular ""mental maps"" of how the world is understood in strategic terms. According to the political scientist Amitav Acharya, the ""Indo-Pacific"" was a concept built by strategists. The Indo-Pacific started to gain ground in international relations literature as a geopolitical challenge by the U.S. toward China.
In its widest sense, the term geopolitically covers all nations and islands surrounding either the Indian Ocean or the Pacific Ocean, encompassing mainland African and Asian nations who border these oceans, such as India and South Africa, Indian Ocean territories such as the Kerguelen Islands and Seychelles, Indonesia (which is within the bounds of both the Indian Ocean and the Pacific), Philippines, Taiwan, China, Korea, Japan, Russia and other Far East nations bordering the Pacific, Australia and all the Pacific Islands east of them, as well as Pacific nations of the Americas such as Canada or Mexico. ASEAN countries (defined as those in Southeast Asia) are considered to be geographically at the centre of the political Indo-Pacific.

Subdivisions
The WWF and Nature Conservancy divide the Indo-Pacific into 3 realms (or subrealms), and each of these into 25 marine provinces and 77 ecoregions (Marine Ecoregions of the World; MEOW) based on data-driven expert opinion. Other schemes for subdivision of the Indo-Pacific have included: 5 provinces, based on endemism in fishes; 3 regions split into 10 provinces based on dissimilarity of fish assemblages, 11 provinces based on range boundaries in corals, 12 divisions split into 124 ecoregions based on biogeographic clustering from coral distributions and finally 8 realms from distributions of 65,000 marine species. All but the last of these schemes were tested against one another by an international consortium of marine scientists using genetic data from 56 Indo-Pacific species, with the reasoning that genetic data should reflect the evolutionary processes that structure the Indo-Pacific. While there was no clear winning scheme, and all schemes were supported by data from at least one species, the genetic data in general favored schemes with few subdivisions, supporting the Indo-Pacific as relatively unstructured biogeographic realm - possibly the world's largest. Below are briefly described the 3 MEOW realms of the Indo-Pacific:

Central Indo-Pacific
The Central Indo-Pacific includes the numerous seas and straits connecting the Indian and Pacific oceans, including the seas surrounding the Indonesian archipelago (with the exception of Sumatra's northwest coast, which is part of the Western Indo-Pacific), the South China Sea, the Philippine Sea, the north coast of Australia, and the seas surrounding New Guinea, western and central Micronesia, New Caledonia, the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Fiji, and Tonga. The Central Indo-Pacific, due in part to its central location at the meeting of two oceans, has the greatest richness and diversity of marine organisms, specifically located within the Coral Triangle, which contains 76% of all known coral species in the world.

Eastern Indo-Pacific
The Eastern Indo-Pacific surrounds the mostly volcanic islands of the central Pacific Ocean, extending from the Marshall Islands in the west through central and southeastern Polynesia to Hawaii, to the west coast of Chile.",Oceans,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pacific,1,indopacific vast biogeographic region earth narrow sense sometimes known indowest pacific indopacific asia comprises tropical water indian ocean western central pacific ocean sea connecting two term especially useful marine biology ichthyology similar field since many marine habitat continuously connected madagascar japan oceania number specie occur range found atlantic ocean distinct marine realm region exceptionally high specie richness world highest specie richness found heart coral triangle remarkable gradient decreasing specie richness radiating outward direction region includes specie fish compared around next richest marine region western atlantic around specie reef building coral compared specie western atlantic term first appeared academic use oceanography geopolitics scholarship shown indopacific concept circulated weimar germany spread interwar japan german political oceanographer envisioned indopacific comprising anticolonial india republican china german ally euroamerica since late term indopacific increasingly used geopolitical discourse symbiotic link quadrilateral security dialogue quad informal grouping australia japan india united state argued concept may lead change popular mental map world understood strategic term according political scientist amitav acharya indopacific concept built strategist indopacific started gain ground international relation literature geopolitical challenge u toward china widest sense term geopolitically cover nation island surrounding either indian ocean pacific ocean encompassing mainland african asian nation border ocean india south africa indian ocean territory kerguelen island seychelles indonesia within bound indian ocean pacific philippine taiwan china korea japan russia far east nation bordering pacific australia pacific island east well pacific nation america canada mexico asean country defined southeast asia considered geographically centre political indopacific subdivision wwf nature conservancy divide indopacific realm subrealms marine province ecoregions marine ecoregions world meow based datadriven expert opinion scheme subdivision indopacific included province based endemism fish region split province based dissimilarity fish assemblage province based range boundary coral division split ecoregions based biogeographic clustering coral distribution finally realm distribution marine specie last scheme tested one another international consortium marine scientist using genetic data indopacific specie reasoning genetic data reflect evolutionary process structure indopacific clear winning scheme scheme supported data least one specie genetic data general favored scheme subdivision supporting indopacific relatively unstructured biogeographic realm possibly world largest briefly described meow realm indopacific central indopacific central indopacific includes numerous sea strait connecting indian pacific ocean including sea surrounding indonesian archipelago exception sumatra northwest coast part western indopacific south china sea philippine sea north coast australia sea surrounding new guinea western central micronesia new caledonia solomon island vanuatu fiji tonga central indopacific due part central location meeting two ocean greatest richness diversity marine organism specifically located within coral triangle contains known coral specie world eastern indopacific eastern indopacific surround mostly volcanic island central pacific ocean extending marshall island west central southeastern polynesia hawaii west coast chile
Baer–Babinet law,"In geography, the Baer–Babinet law, sometimes called Baer's law, identifies a way in which the process of formation of rivers is influenced by the rotation of the Earth. According to the hypothesis, because of the rotation of the Earth, erosion occurs mostly on the right banks of rivers in the Northern Hemisphere, and in the Southern Hemisphere on the left banks.
The concept was originally introduced by a French physicist Jacques Babinet in 1859 using mathematical deduction and Coriolis force. A more definitive explanation was given by Baltic German scientist Karl Ernst von Baer in 1860.
Although it is possible that an aggregate measurement of all rivers would lead to a correlation with the Baer–Babinet law, the Coriolis force is orders of magnitude weaker than the local forces on the river channel from its flow. Therefore, this is unlikely to be important in any given river. Albert Einstein wrote a paper in 1926 explaining the true causes of the phenomenon (see tea leaf paradox).

Desert pavement,"A desert pavement, also called reg (in western Sahara), serir (in eastern Sahara), gibber (in Australia), or saï (in central Asia) is a desert surface covered with closely packed, interlocking angular or rounded rock fragments of pebble and cobble size. They typically top alluvial fans. Desert varnish collects on the exposed surface rocks over time.
Geologists debate the mechanics of pavement formation and their age.

Formation
Several theories have been proposed for the formation of desert pavements.  A common theory suggests that they form through the gradual removal of sand, dust and other fine-grained material by the wind and intermittent rain, leaving the larger fragments behind. The larger fragments are shaken into place through the forces of rain, running water, wind, gravity, creep, thermal expansion and contraction, wetting and drying, frost heaving, animal traffic, and the Earth's constant microseismic vibrations. The removal of small particles by wind does not continue indefinitely, because once the pavement forms, it acts as a barrier to resist further erosion. The small particles collect underneath the pavement surface, forming a vesicular A soil horizon (designated ""Av"").
A second theory supposes that desert pavements form from the shrink/swell properties of the clay underneath the pavement; when precipitation is absorbed by clay it causes it to expand, and when it dries it cracks along planes of weakness. Over time, this geomorphic action transports small pebbles to the surface, where they stay through lack of precipitation that would otherwise destroy the pavement by transport of the clasts or excessive vegetative growth.

A newer theory suggests that desert pavements form through depositions of windblown dust atop preexisting rocks. The dust then settles beneath the rocks, forming a layer of soil, while the rocks at the top crack and begin to merge into desert pavement. In 1995, researchers conducted a study in the Mojave Desert using helium-3 dating where they determined the rocks to be of older age than the soil beneath, leading to the conclusion of ""stone pavements [being] born at the surface.""
Desert pavement surfaces are often coated with desert varnish, a dark brown, sometimes shiny coating that contains clay minerals. In the US a famous example can be found on Newspaper Rock in southeastern Utah. Desert varnish is a thin coating (patina) of clays, iron, and manganese on the surface of sun-baked boulders. Micro-organisms may also play a role in their formation. Desert varnish is also prevalent in the Mojave desert and Great Basin geomorphic province.

Local names
Stony deserts may be known by different names according to the region. Examples include:
Gibbers:  Covering extensive areas in Australia such as parts of the Tirari-Sturt stony desert ecoregion are desert pavements called Gibber Plains after the pebbles or gibbers. Gibber is also used to describe ecological communities, such as Gibber Chenopod Shrublands or Gibber Transition Shrublands.
In North Africa, a vast stony desert plain is known as reg. This is in contrast with erg, which refers to a sandy desert area.

The central science,"Chemistry is often called the central science because of its role in connecting the physical sciences, which include chemistry, with the life sciences, pharmaceutical sciences and applied sciences such as medicine and engineering. The nature of this relationship is one of the main topics in the philosophy of chemistry and in scientometrics. The phrase was popularized by its use in a textbook by Theodore L. Brown and H. Eugene LeMay, titled Chemistry: The Central Science, which was first published in 1977, with a fifteenth edition published in 2021.
The central role of chemistry can be seen in the systematic and hierarchical classification of the sciences by Auguste Comte. Each discipline provides a more general framework for the area it precedes (mathematics → astronomy → physics → chemistry → biology → social sciences). Balaban and Klein have more recently proposed a diagram showing the partial ordering of sciences in which chemistry may be argued is ""the central science"" since it provides a significant degree of branching. In forming these connections the lower field cannot be fully reduced to the higher ones. It is recognized that the lower fields possess emergent ideas and concepts that do not exist in the higher fields of science.
Thus chemistry is built on an understanding of laws of physics that govern particles such as atoms, protons, neutrons, electrons, thermodynamics, etc. although it has been shown that it has not been ""fully 'reduced' to quantum mechanics"". Concepts such as the periodicity of the elements and chemical bonds in chemistry are emergent in that they are more than the underlying forces defined by physics.
In the same way, biology cannot be fully reduced to chemistry, although the machinery that is responsible for life is composed of molecules. For instance, the machinery of evolution may be described in terms of chemistry by the understanding that it is a mutation in the order of genetic base pairs in the DNA of an organism. However, chemistry cannot fully describe the process since it does not contain concepts such as natural selection that are responsible for driving evolution. Chemistry is fundamental to biology since it provides a methodology for studying and understanding the molecules that compose cells.
Connections made by chemistry are formed through various sub-disciplines that utilize concepts from multiple scientific disciplines. Chemistry and physics are both needed in the areas of physical chemistry, nuclear chemistry, and theoretical chemistry. Chemistry and biology intersect in the areas of biochemistry, medicinal chemistry, molecular biology, chemical biology, molecular genetics, and immunochemistry. Chemistry and the earth sciences intersect in areas like geochemistry and hydrology.

Extremes on Earth,"This article lists extreme locations on Earth that hold geographical records or are otherwise known for their geophysical or meteorological superlatives. All of these locations are Earth-wide extremes; extremes of individual continents or countries are not listed.

Latitude and longitude
Northernmost
The northernmost point of land is the northern tip of Kaffeklubben Island, north of Greenland (83°40′N 29°50′W), which lies slightly north of Cape Morris Jesup, Greenland (83°38′N 32°40′W). Various shifting gravel bars lie farther north, the most famous being Oodaaq. There have been other islands more northern such as 83-42 and ATOW1996 but they have not been confirmed as permanent.

Southernmost
The southernmost continental point of land outside Antarctica is in South America at Cape Froward, Magallanes Region, Chile (53°56′00″S 071°20′00″W).
The southernmost point of (liquid) water is a bay on the Filchner–Ronne Ice Shelf along the coast of Antarctica (83°S 59°W), about 100 km (60 mi) south of Berkner Island.
The southernmost point of ocean is located on the Gould Coast (84°30′S 150°0′W).
The southernmost point of open ocean is in the Bay of Whales, also part of the Ross Sea, at 78°30'S, at the edge of the Ross Ice Shelf.
The southernmost island is considered to be Deverall Island, near the Shackleton Coast, surrounded by the Ross Ice Shelf although there is an island in Lake Vostok but it is currently under ice.

Easternmost and westernmost
The easternmost and westernmost points on Earth, based on the east–west standard for describing longitude, can be found anywhere along the 180th meridian, which passes through the Arctic, Pacific, and Southern Oceans, as well as parts of Siberia (including Wrangel Island), Antarctica, and three islands of Fiji (Vanua Levu's eastern peninsula, the middle of Taveuni, and the western part of Rabi Island).
Using instead the path of the International Date Line (which is not a straight line), i.e. define ""easternmost"" as ""the first to see a new day"" and define ""westernmost"" as ""the last to see a new day"", the westernmost point on land is Attu Island, Alaska, and the easternmost point on land is Caroline Island, Kiribati.

Millarworld,"Millarworld Limited is an imprint of comic books published by Scottish comic book writer Mark Millar as a creator-owned line, featuring characters created by him in a shared fictional universe, the Millarworld, or Millarverse. These characters include Wesley Gibson, Kick-Ass, Hit-Girl, Eggsy Unwin, Nemesis, Duke McQueen, Edison Crane, and others, while the events of The Unfunnies, Jupiter's Legacy, and Supercrooks exist as popular fiction within the world of the Millarworld. The imprint was launched in 2003 with the publication of the miniseries Wanted, followed by Kick-Ass – The Dave Lizewski Years, Kingsman, War Heroes, and The Magic Order, and later the crossover series Big Game. While the majority of series in the line are written by Millar himself, the series Kingsman, Kick-Ass – The New Girl and Hit-Girl feature new writers from their second volumes onward, after Millar wrote the series' first volumes.

Licensing and adaptation
Wanted, published by Top Cow Productions, was loosely adapted into a feature film of the same name by Universal Pictures, released on 27 June 2008. Chosen, published by Dark Horse Comics, was described by Millar as a sequel to the Bible, and has been optioned by Sony Pictures. The Unfunnies was an anthropomorphic animal horror story published by Avatar Press. Kick-Ass, which was illustrated by John Romita Jr. and published by Marvel, was adapted into a film of the same name by Matthew Vaughn, and released in the United Kingdom on 26 March 2010 and the United States on 16 April.
In September 2008 it was announced that the yet unfinished War Heroes had been optioned by Sony Pictures Entertainment, with Michael De Luca as producer and Millar taking an executive producer role.
Millar has stated that whenever he sells the film adaptation rights to one of his creator-owned comics properties, he gives half of the money to the artist who illustrated the comics, despite his agent's reaction to this, saying, ""Everything, all the money from the advance, the toys, the games, 50–50, so it's fair. I see it as a collaboration. If I drew, I could keep everything for myself, but I actually like the idea of having a talent that I'm not selling. One of my friends said, 'You could make even more money by drawing, too,' and I said, 'Yeah, and I suppose I could make even more money by lap dancing. It's nice to have something that's just for me.""

History
In October 2014, following months of delays for Jupiter's Legacy #5, Millar stated that beginning in April 2015, all Millarworld series would be completely drawn before the publication of their debut issues, in order to maintain a monthly schedule.
On 7 August 2017, Millarworld was acquired by the American streaming media company Netflix.
The first comic book series that Millarworld published post acquisition was The Magic Order. The first issue was published on 13 June 2018.
On 17 July 2018 it was announced that Netflix had started work on the first set of films to be adapted from comics. These are: Empress, Huck and Sharkey the Bounty Hunter. The comic book series Jupiter's Legacy and American Jesus will be adapted as television series.
On 6 December 2018, Millar provided an update to the progress of the Millarworld properties adapted for Netflix. Jupiter's Legacy would be the first television series announced, with Steven S. DeKnight as planned as showrunner (before Sang Kyu Kim took over following DeKnight's exit from the series), with The Chosen One (based on American Jesus) as the second live-action television series released, with Everardo Gout and Leopoldo Gout as the showrunners and Gout serving as director. Empress, Sharkey the Bounty Hunter and Huck are scheduled to be feature films in development. Under Netflix, Millar will exclusively adapt new Millarworld properties to the streaming service, with select properties having comic book tie-ins, starting with Prodigy.
On 11 March 2019, Netflix announced that it would produce an anime series based on Supercrooks. It was be produced by Bones.
In late 2022, several updates on Millarworld production were given, including that Huck would be redeveloped as a TV series as opposed to a movie and that a live-action Supercrooks series would follow Jupiter's Legacy after the show was canceled after its first season. That same year it was announced that Millar would be launching four brand new comic series (Night Club, Nemesis: Reloaded, The Magic Order 4 and The Ambassadors) and that they would lead into a crossover event entitled Big Game, which would be illustrated by Pepe Larraz and serve as a crossover between every Millarworld property.
In May 2023, it was revealed that Big Game is actually a sequel to Wanted, Millar's first creator-owned work, and follows Wesley Gibson and the Fraternity teaming up with Matthew Anderson / Nemesis to take down the latest wave of superheroes that have popped back up in the world following the actions of Dave Lizewski / Kick-Ass.

Lake,"A lake is often a naturally occurring, relatively large and fixed body of water on or near the Earth's surface. It is localized in a basin or interconnected basins surrounded by dry land. Lakes lie completely on land and are separate from the ocean, although they may be connected with the ocean by rivers. Lakes, as with other bodies of water, are part of the water cycle, the processes by which water moves around the Earth. Most lakes are fresh water and account for almost all the world's surface freshwater, but some are salt lakes with salinities even higher than that of seawater. Lakes vary significantly in surface area and volume of water.
Lakes are typically larger and deeper than ponds, which are also water-filled basins on land, although there are no official definitions or scientific criteria distinguishing the two. Lakes are also distinct from lagoons, which are generally shallow tidal pools dammed by sandbars or other material at coastal regions of oceans or large lakes. Most lakes are fed by springs, and both fed and drained by creeks and rivers, but some lakes are endorheic without any outflow, while volcanic lakes are filled directly by precipitation runoffs and do not have any inflow streams.
Natural lakes are generally found in mountainous areas (i.e. alpine lakes), dormant volcanic craters, rift zones and areas with ongoing glaciation.  Other lakes are found in depressed landforms or along the courses of mature rivers, where a river channel has widened over a basin formed by eroded floodplains and wetlands. Some lakes are found in caverns underground. Some parts of the world have many lakes formed by the chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last ice age. All lakes are temporary over long periods of time, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.
Artificially controlled lakes are known as reservoirs, and are usually constructed for industrial or agricultural use, for hydroelectric power generation, for supplying domestic drinking water, for ecological or recreational purposes, or for other human activities.

Etymology, meaning, and usage of ""lake""
The word lake comes from Middle English lake ('lake, pond, waterway'), from Old English lacu ('pond, pool, stream'), from Proto-Germanic *lakō ('pond, ditch, slow moving stream'), from the Proto-Indo-European root *leǵ- ('to leak, drain'). Cognates include Dutch laak ('lake, pond, ditch'), Middle Low German lāke ('water pooled in a riverbed, puddle') as in: de:Wolfslake, de:Butterlake, German Lache ('pool, puddle'), and Icelandic lækur ('slow flowing stream'). Also related are the English words leak and leach.
There is considerable uncertainty about defining the difference between lakes and ponds, and neither term has an internationally accepted definition across scientific disciplines or political boundaries. For example, limnologists have defined lakes as water bodies that are simply a larger version of a pond, which can have wave action on the shoreline or where wind-induced turbulence plays a major role in mixing the water column. None of these definitions completely excludes ponds and all are difficult to measure. For this reason, simple size-based definitions are increasingly used to separate ponds and lakes. Definitions for lake range in minimum sizes for a body of water from 2 hectares (5 acres): 331  to 8 hectares (20 acres). Pioneering animal ecologist Charles Elton regarded lakes as waterbodies of 40 hectares (99 acres) or more. The term lake is also used to describe a feature such as Lake Eyre, which is a dry basin most of the time but may become filled under seasonal conditions of heavy rainfall. In common usage, many lakes bear names ending with the word pond, and a lesser number of names ending with lake are, in quasi-technical fact, ponds. One textbook illustrates this point with the following: ""In Newfoundland, for example, almost every lake is called a pond, whereas in Wisconsin, almost every pond is called a lake.""
One hydrology book proposes to define the term ""lake"" as a body of water with the following five characteristics:

It partially or totally fills one or several basins connected by straits;
It has essentially the same water level in all parts (except for relatively short-lived variations caused by wind, varying ice cover, large inflows, etc.);
It does not have regular intrusion of seawater;
A considerable portion of the sediment suspended in the water is captured by the basins (for this to happen they need to have a sufficiently small inflow-to-volume ratio);
The area measured at the mean water level exceeds an arbitrarily chosen threshold (for instance, one hectare).
With the exception of criterion 3, the others have been accepted or elaborated upon by other hydrology publications.

Ridge,"A ridge is a long, narrow, elevated geomorphologic landform, structural feature, or a combination of both separated from the surrounding terrain by steep sides. The sides of a ridge slope away from a narrow top, the crest or ridgecrest, with the terrain dropping down on either side. The crest, if narrow, is also called a ridgeline. Limitations on the dimensions of a ridge are lacking. Its height above the surrounding terrain can vary from less than a meter to hundreds of meters. A ridge can be either depositional, erosional, tectonic, or a combination of these in origin and can consist of either bedrock, loose sediment, lava, or ice depending on its origin. A ridge can occur as either an isolated, independent feature or part of a larger geomorphological and/or structural feature. Frequently, a ridge can be further subdivided into smaller geomorphic or structural elements.

Classification
As in the case of landforms in general, there is a lack of any commonly agreed classification or typology of ridges. They can be defined and classified on the basis of a variety of factors including either genesis, morphology, composition, statistical analysis of remote sensing data, or some combinations of these factors.
An example of ridge classification is that of Schoeneberger and Wysocki, which provides a relatively simple and straightforward system that is used by the USA National Cooperative Soil Survey Program to classify ridges and other landforms. This system uses the dominant geomorphic process or setting to classify different groups of landforms into two major groups, Geomorphic Environments and Other Groupings with a total of 16 subgroups. The groups and their subgroups are not mutually exclusive; landforms, including ridges, can belong to multiple subgroups. In this classification, ridges are found in the Aeolian, Coastal Marine and Estuarine, Lacustrine, Glacial, Volcanic and Hydrothermal, Tectonic and Structural, Slope, and Erosional subgroups.

Aeolian ridge
Aeolian dune ridge
An aeolian dune ridge is a ridge of sand piled up by the wind. A sand dune can be either a hill or ridge of sand piled up by the wind. A single sand dune can range in length from less than one meter to several tens of kilometers, their height can vary from a few tens of centimeters to a 150 meters. Megadunes or draas are very large dunes, which can have smaller dunes superimposed on them.

Coastal ridges
Beach ridge
A beach ridge is a low, essentially continuous ridge of beach or beach-and-dune sediments piled up by the action of waves and currents on a shoreline beyond the present limit of storm waves and the reach of ordinary tides. They occur occurring singly or as one of a series of approximately parallel ridges that are roughly parallel to the shoreline.

Erosional ridges
Dendritic ridge
In typical dissected plateau terrain, the stream drainage valleys will leave intervening ridges. These are by far the most common ridges. These ridges usually represent slightly more erosion resistant rock, but not always – they often remain because there were more joints where the valleys formed or other chance occurrences. This type of ridge is generally somewhat random in orientation, often changing direction frequently, often with knobs at intervals on the ridge top.
Strike ridge
A strike ridge is an asymmetric ridge created by the differential erosion of a hard, erosion-resistant, dipping layer of rock sandwiched between layers of weaker, more easily eroded rock. A strike ridge has a distinctly gentler sloping side (dip slope), that roughly parallels the inclined layer of erosion-resistant rock. The opposite side of a strike ridge is relatively short, steep or cliff-like slope (scarp slope) that cuts across the tilted layers of rocks. In foldbelts such as the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians, they form series of long, parallel, straight to arcuate ridges. Strike ridges are subdivided into cuestas, flatirons, homoclinal ridges, and hogbacks.
Reef
A term applied by early explorers and settlers in the western United States to ridges that formed a rocky barrier to land travel, by analogy with ocean reefs as barriers to sea travel. Examples include Capitol Reef National Park and the San Rafael Reef. The usage may have originated with sailors during the Australian gold rushes to describe the gold-bearing ridges of Bendigo, Australia.

Glacial ridges
Moraines and eskers
Glacial activity may leave ridges in the form of moraines and eskers. An arête is a thin ridge of rock that is formed by glacial erosion.
Pressure ridge (ice)
An ice pressure ridge is a ridge of deformed ice along the boundaries of individual ice floes when the ice floes on a lake or ocean collide and compress their edges. The average height of a sea ice pressure ridge is between 5 and 30 meters.

Tectonic and Structural ridges

Building block (chemistry),"Building block is a term in chemistry which is used to describe a virtual molecular fragment or a real chemical compound the molecules of which possess reactive functional groups. Building blocks are used for bottom-up modular assembly of molecular architectures: nano-particles, metal-organic frameworks, organic molecular constructs, supra-molecular complexes. Using building blocks ensures strict control of what a final compound or a (supra)molecular construct will be.

Building blocks for medicinal chemistry
In medicinal chemistry, the term defines either imaginable, virtual molecular fragments or chemical reagents from which drugs or drug candidates might be constructed or synthetically prepared.

Virtual building blocks
Virtual building blocks are used in drug discovery for drug design and virtual screening, addressing the desire to have controllable molecular morphologies that interact with biological targets. Of special interest for this purpose are the building blocks common to known biologically active compounds, in particular, known drugs, or natural products.  There are algorithms for de novo design of molecular architectures by assembly of drug-derived virtual building blocks.

Chemical reagents as building blocks
Organic functionalized molecules (reagents), carefully selected for the use in modular synthesis of novel drug candidates, in particular, by combinatorial chemistry, or in order to realize the ideas of virtual screening and drug design are also called building blocks. To be practically useful for the modular drug or drug candidate assembly, the building blocks should be either mono-functionalised or possessing selectively chemically addressable functional groups, for example, orthogonally protected. Selection criteria applied to organic functionalized molecules to be included in the building block collections for medicinal chemistry are usually based on empirical rules aimed at drug-like properties of the final drug candidates. Bioisosteric replacements of the molecular fragments in drug candidates could be made using analogous building blocks.

Building blocks and chemical industry
The building block approach to drug discovery changed the landscape of chemical industry which supports medicinal chemistry. Major chemical suppliers for medicinal chemistry like Maybridge, Chembridge, Enamine adjusted their business correspondingly. By the end of the 1990th the use of building block collections prepared for fast and reliable construction of small-molecule sets of compounds (libraries) for biological screening became one of the major strategies for pharmaceutical industry involved in drug discovery; modular, usually one-step synthesis of compounds for biological screening from building blocks turned out to be in most cases faster and more reliable than multistep, even convergent syntheses of target compounds.
There are online web-resources.

Examples
Typical examples of building block collections for medicinal chemistry are libraries of fluorine-containing building blocks. Introduction of the fluorine into a molecule has been shown to be beneficial for its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, therefore, the fluorine-substituted building blocks in drug design increase the probability of finding drug leads. Other examples include natural and unnatural amino acid libraries, collections of conformationally constrained bifunctionalized compounds and diversity-oriented  building block collections.

Poetics,"Poetics is the study or theory of poetry, specifically the study or theory of device, structure, form, type, and effect with regards to poetry, though usage of the term can also refer to literature broadly. Poetics is distinguished from hermeneutics by its focus on the synthesis of non-semantic elements in a text rather than its semantic interpretation. Most literary criticism combines poetics and hermeneutics in a single analysis; however, one or the other may predominate given the text and the aims of the one doing the reading.

History of Poetics
Western Poetics
Generally speaking, poetics in the western tradition emerged out of Ancient Greece. Fragments of Homer and Hesiod represent the earliest Western treatments of poetic theory, followed later by the work of the lyricist Pindar. The term poetics derives from the Ancient Greek ποιητικός poietikos ""pertaining to poetry""; also ""creative"" and ""productive"". It stems, not surprisingly, from the word for poetry, ""poiesis"" (ποίησις) meaning ""the activity in which a person brings something into being that did not exist before."" Ποίησις itself derives from the Doric word ""poiéō"" (ποιέω) which translates, simply, as ""to make."" In the Western world, the development and evolution of poetics featured three artistic movements concerned with poetical composition: (1) the formalist, (2) the objectivist, and (3) the Aristotelian.

Plato's Republic
The Republic by Plato represents the first major Western work to treat the theory of poetry. In Book III Plato defines poetry as a type of narrative which takes one of three forms: the ""simple,"" the ""imitative"" (mimetic), or any mix of the two. In Book X, Plato argues that poetry is too many degrees removed from the ideal form to be anything other than deceptive and, therefore, dangerous. Only capable of producing these ineffectual copies of copies, poets had no place in his utopic city.

Aristotle's Poetics
Aristotle's Poetics is one of the first extant philosophical treatise to attempt a rigorous taxonomy of literature. The work was lost to the Western world for a long time. It was available in the Middle Ages and early Renaissance only through a Latin translation of an Arabic commentary written by Averroes and translated by Hermannus Alemannus in 1256. The accurate Greek-Latin translation made by William of Moerbeke in 1278 was virtually ignored. The Arabic translation departed widely in vocabulary from the original Poetics and it initiated a misinterpretation of Aristotelian thought that continued through the Middle Ages. 
The Poetics itemized the salient genres of ancient Greek drama into three categories (comedy, tragedy, and the satyr play) while drawing a larger-scale distinction between drama, lyric poetry, and the epic. Aristotle also critically revised Plato's interpretation of mimesis which Aristotle believed represented a natural human instinct for imitation, an instinct which could be found at the core of all poetry. 
Modern poetics developed in Renaissance Italy. The need to interpret ancient literary texts in the light of Christianity, to appraise and assess the narratives of Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio, contributed to the development of complex discourses on literary theory. Thanks first of all to Giovanni Boccaccio's Genealogia Deorum Gentilium (1360), the literate elite gained a rich understanding of metaphorical and figurative tropes. Giorgio Valla's 1498 Latin translation of Aristotle's text (the first to be published) was included with the 1508 Aldine printing of the Greek original as part of an anthology of Rhetores graeci. There followed an ever-expanding corpus of texts on poetics in the later fifteenth century and throughout the sixteenth, a phenomenon that began in Italy and spread to Spain, England, and France. Among the most important Renaissance works on poetics are Marco Girolamo Vida's De Arte Poetica (1527) and Gian Giorgio Trissino's La Poetica (1529, expanded edition 1563). By the early decades of the sixteenth century, vernacular versions of Aristotle's Poetics appeared, culminating in Lodovico Castelvetro's Italian editions of 1570 and 1576. Luis de Góngora (1561–1627) and Baltasar Gracián (1601–58) brought a different kind of sophistication to poetic. Emanuele Tesauro wrote extensively in his Il Cannocchiale Aristotelico (The Aristotelian Spyglass, 1654), on figure ingeniose and figure metaforiche. During the Romantic era, poetics tended toward expressionism and emphasized the perceiving subject. Twentieth-century poetics returned to the Aristotelian paradigm, followed by trends toward meta-criticality, and the establishment of a contemporary theory of poetics. Eastern poetics developed lyric poetry, rather than the representational mimetic poetry of the Western world.

Desert,"A desert is a landscape where little precipitation occurs and, consequently, living conditions create unique biomes and ecosystems. The lack of vegetation exposes the unprotected surface of the ground to denudation. About one-third of the land surface of the Earth is arid or semi-arid. This includes much of the polar regions, where little precipitation occurs, and which are sometimes called polar deserts or ""cold deserts"". Deserts can be classified by the amount of precipitation that falls, by the temperature that prevails, by the causes of desertification or by their geographical location.
Deserts are formed by weathering processes as large variations in temperature between day and night strain the rocks, which consequently break in pieces. Although rain seldom occurs in deserts, there are occasional downpours that can result in flash floods. Rain falling on hot rocks can cause them to shatter, and the resulting fragments and rubble strewn over the desert floor are further eroded by the wind. This picks up particles of sand and dust, which can remain airborne for extended periods – sometimes causing the formation of sand storms or dust storms. Wind-blown sand grains striking any solid object in their path can abrade the surface. Rocks are smoothed down, and the wind sorts sand into uniform deposits. The grains end up as level sheets of sand or are piled high in billowing dunes. Other deserts are flat, stony plains where all the fine material has been blown away and the surface consists of a mosaic of smooth stones, often forming desert pavements, and little further erosion occurs. Other desert features include rock outcrops, exposed bedrock and clays once deposited by flowing water. Temporary lakes may form and salt pans may be left when waters evaporate. There may be underground water sources in the form of springs and seepages from aquifers. Where these are found, oases can occur.
Plants and animals living in the desert need special adaptations to survive in the harsh environment. Plants tend to be tough and wiry with small or no leaves, water-resistant cuticles, and often spines to deter herbivory. Some annual plants germinate, bloom, and die within a few weeks after rainfall, while other long-lived plants survive for years and have deep root systems that are able to tap underground moisture. Animals need to keep cool and find enough food and water to survive. Many are nocturnal and stay in the shade or underground during the day's heat. They tend to be efficient at conserving water, extracting most of their needs from their food and concentrating their urine. Some animals remain in a state of dormancy for long periods, ready to become active again during the rare rainfall. They then reproduce rapidly while conditions are favorable before returning to dormancy.
People have struggled to live in deserts and the surrounding semi-arid lands for millennia. Nomads have moved their flocks and herds to wherever grazing is available, and oases have provided opportunities for a more settled way of life. The cultivation of semi-arid regions encourages erosion of soil and is one of the causes of increased desertification. Desert farming is possible with the aid of irrigation, and the Imperial Valley in California provides an example of how previously barren land can be made productive by the import of water from an outside source. Many trade routes have been forged across deserts, especially across the Sahara, and traditionally were used by caravans of camels carrying salt, gold, ivory and other goods. Large numbers of slaves were also taken northwards across the Sahara. Some mineral extraction also takes place in deserts, and the uninterrupted sunlight gives potential for capturing large quantities of solar energy.

Etymology
English desert and its Romance cognates (including Italian and Portuguese deserto, French désert and Spanish desierto) all come from the ecclesiastical Latin dēsertum (originally ""an abandoned place""), a participle of dēserere, ""to abandon"". The correlation between aridity and sparse population is complex and dynamic, varying by culture, era, and technologies; thus the use of the word desert can cause confusion. In English before the 20th century, desert was often used in the sense of ""unpopulated area"", without specific reference to aridity; but today the word is most often used in its climate-science sense (an area of low precipitation). Phrases such as ""desert island"" and ""Great American Desert"", or Shakespeare's ""deserts of Bohemia"" (The Winter's Tale) in previous centuries did not necessarily imply sand or aridity; their focus was the sparse population.

Major deserts
Deserts occupy about one third of Earth's land surface. Bottomlands may be salt-covered flats. Eolian processes are major factors in shaping desert landscapes. Polar deserts (also seen as ""cold deserts"") have similar features, except the main form of precipitation is snow rather than rain.

Riccardo D'Auria,"Riccardo D'Auria (born 1940) is an Italian theoretical physicist and an emeritus full professor of the Polytechnic University of Turin.

Early life and education
Riccardo D'Auria was born in Rome, Italy in 1940. He graduated in Physics at the University of Turin, under the supervision of Prof. Tullio Regge.

Career
He was an associate professor at the University of Turin, a full professor at  University of Padua and, eventually, at the Polytechnic University of Turin. There he founded a theoretical physics group, oriented towards particle physics, field theory, gravity and supergravity. From 1996 to 2000 he was director of the Department of Physics of the Polytechnic University of Turin.
He spent several extended periods at CERN and at the UCLA University (USA).

Contributions
Riccardo D'Auria contributed, in the early years of superstring theory and in collaboration with a group of string theorists, to the introduction of internal flavour symmetry and color symmetry in a string algebra.
In collaboration with Pietro G. Frè (and following a proposal by Y. Ne'eman and T. Regge), he developed a new approach to supergravity called geometric or rheonomic approach. Of special interest is the application of this approach to the study of theories where the physical fields include p-forms of degree higher than one, in particular, the eleven-dimensional supergravity, the low-energy description of M-theory.  By a generalisation of the Cartan-Maurer equations of an ordinary (graded) Lie algebra, a new graded algebra was introduced, called Cartan integrable system, by means of which a geometric approach to higher-dimensional theories can be realised
This mathematical structure is the first example of an  L-infinity algebra developed in mathematics some ten years after their original results, and formulated in the space dual to the space of differential p-forms.
In collaboration with Tullio Regge, R. D'Auria explicitly constructed an asymptotically flat gravitational instanton solution of the four-dimensional Einstein theory.
He also completed, with Leonardo Castellani and Sergio Ferrara, the full formulation of Special Kaehler Geometry, which allows the precise formulation of N=2 supergravity in four dimensions. This eventually led him, within a different collaboration, to obtain the result of constructing the most general matter-coupled N=2 supergravity in four dimensions.

Landlocked developing countries,"The landlocked developing countries (LLDC) are developing countries that are landlocked. Due to the economic and other disadvantages suffered by such countries, the majority of landlocked countries are least developed countries (LDCs), with inhabitants of these countries occupying the bottom billion tier of the world's population in terms of poverty. Outside of Europe, there is not a single highly developed landlocked country as measured by the Human Development Index (HDI), and nine of the twelve countries with the lowest HDI scores are landlocked. Landlocked European countries are exceptions in terms of development outcomes due to their close integration with the regional European market. Landlocked countries that rely on transoceanic trade usually suffer a cost of trade that is double that of their maritime neighbours. Landlocked countries experience economic growth 6% less than non-landlocked countries, holding other variables constant.
32 out of the world's 44 landlocked countries, including all the landlocked countries in Africa, Asia, and South America, have been classified as Landlocked Developing Countries by the United Nations. As of 2012, about 442.8 million people lived in these LLDCs.

UN-OHRLLS
The United Nations has an Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States (UN-OHRLLS). It mainly holds the view that high transport costs due to distance and terrain result in the erosion of competitive edge for exports from landlocked countries. In addition, it recognizes the constraints on landlocked countries to be mainly physical, including lack of direct access to the sea, isolation from world markets and high transit costs due to physical distance. It also attributes geographic remoteness as one of the most significant reasons why developing landlocked nations cannot alleviate themselves, while European landlocked cases are mostly developed because of short distances to the sea through well-developed countries. One other commonly cited factor is the administrative burdens associated with border crossings, as there is a heavy load of bureaucratic procedures, paperwork, custom charges, and most importantly, traffic delay due to border wait times, which affect delivery contracts. Delays and inefficiency compound geographically: thus a two- to three-week wait due to border customs between Uganda and Kenya makes it impossible to book ships ahead of time in Mombasa, furthering delivery contract delays. Despite these explanations, it is also important to consider the transit countries that neighbour LLDCs, from whose ports the goods of LLDCs are exported.

Although Adam Smith and traditional thought hold that geography and transportation are the culprits for keeping LLDCs from realizing development gains, Faye, Sachs and Snow hold the argument that no matter the advancement of infrastructure or lack of geographic distance to a port, landlocked nations are still dependent on their neighbouring transit nations. Outlying this specific relationship of dependency, Faye et al. insist that though LLDCs vary across the board in terms of HDI index scores, LLDCs almost uniformly straddle at the bottom of HDI rankings in terms of region, suggesting a correlated dependency relationship of development for landlocked countries with their respective regions. In fact, HDI levels decrease as one moves inland along the major transit route that runs from the coast of Kenya, across the country before going through Uganda, Rwanda and then finally Burundi. Just recently, it has been economically modeled that if the economic size of a transit country is increased by just 1%, a subsequent increase of at least 2% is experienced by the landlocked country, which shows that there is hope for LLDCs if the conditions of their transit neighbours are addressed. In fact, some LLDCs are seeing the brighter side of such a relationship, with the Central Asian nations geographic location between three BRICS nations (China, Russia and India) hungry for the region's oil and mineral wealth serving to boost economic development. The three major factors that LLDCs are dependent on their transit neighbours are dependence on transit infrastructure, dependence on political relations with neighbours, and dependence on internal peace and stability within transit neighbours.

Burundi
Burundi has relatively good internal road networks, but it cannot export its goods using the most direct route to the sea since the inland infrastructure of Tanzania is poorly connected to the port of Dar es Salaam. Thus Burundi relies on Kenya's port of Mombasa for export; but this route was severed briefly in the 1990s when political relations with Kenya deteriorated. Further, Burundi's exports could not pass through Mozambique around the same time due to the Mozambican Civil War (1977–1992). Thus, Burundi had to export its goods using a 4500 km route, crossing se",Geography,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landlocked_developing_countries,1,landlocked developing country lldc developing country landlocked due economic disadvantage suffered country majority landlocked country least developed country ldcs inhabitant country occupying bottom billion tier world population term poverty outside europe single highly developed landlocked country measured human development index hdi nine twelve country lowest hdi score landlocked landlocked european country exception term development outcome due close integration regional european market landlocked country rely transoceanic trade usually suffer cost trade double maritime neighbour landlocked country experience economic growth less nonlandlocked country holding variable constant world landlocked country including landlocked country africa asia south america classified landlocked developing country united nation million people lived lldcs unohrlls united nation office high representative least developed country landlocked developing country small island developing state unohrlls mainly hold view high transport cost due distance terrain result erosion competitive edge export landlocked country addition recognizes constraint landlocked country mainly physical including lack direct access sea isolation world market high transit cost due physical distance also attribute geographic remoteness one significant reason developing landlocked nation alleviate european landlocked case mostly developed short distance sea welldeveloped country one commonly cited factor administrative burden associated border crossing heavy load bureaucratic procedure paperwork custom charge importantly traffic delay due border wait time affect delivery contract delay inefficiency compound geographically thus two threeweek wait due border custom uganda kenya make impossible book ship ahead time mombasa furthering delivery contract delay despite explanation also important consider transit country neighbour lldcs whose port good lldcs exported dependency problem although adam smith traditional thought hold geography transportation culprit keeping lldcs realizing development gain faye sachs snow hold argument matter advancement infrastructure lack geographic distance port landlocked nation still dependent neighbouring transit nation outlying specific relationship dependency faye et al insist though lldcs vary across board term hdi index score lldcs almost uniformly straddle bottom hdi ranking term region suggesting correlated dependency relationship development landlocked country respective region fact hdi level decrease one move inland along major transit route run coast kenya across country going uganda rwanda finally burundi recently economically modeled economic size transit country increased subsequent increase least experienced landlocked country show hope lldcs condition transit neighbour addressed fact lldcs seeing brighter side relationship central asian nation geographic location three brics nation china russia india hungry region oil mineral wealth serving boost economic development three major factor lldcs dependent transit neighbour dependence transit infrastructure dependence political relation neighbour dependence internal peace stability within transit neighbour burundi burundi relatively good internal road network export good using direct route sea since inland infrastructure tanzania poorly connected port dar e salaam thus burundi relies kenya port mombasa export route severed briefly political relation kenya deteriorated burundi export could pas mozambique around time due mozambican civil war – thus burundi export good using km route crossing se
Mathematical oncology,"Mathematical oncology is the use of modeling and simulations applied to the study of cancer (oncology).

History
Teorell made preliminary efforts to model in a work published 1937 because of the problem of the time a drug injected exists within the body was an unknown. Modelling by epidemiological data originated in 1954.

Modeling
Modeling types:

epidemiological data
mechanistical:  tumor growth conceptualized from conceptualization of the tumor matter as a type of mechanism
cancer cell population evolution
Models use ordinary differential equations and partial differential equations to represent tumor growth, angiogenesis, metastasis development, and treatment responses.

Simulations
Simulation of cancer behavior potentially reduces the need for early-phase experimental trials.

Treatment/therapy
Researchers develop models that describe tumor dynamics, the effects of treatment, to remedy possible non-optimal treatment responses supporting the development of more effective treatment protocols.
Control theory and optimization are applied to treatment planning in cancer therapies, particularly in radiotherapy and chemotherapy. By optimizing dose schedules and timing, mathematical oncology aims to maximize therapeutic efficacy while minimizing adverse effects.

Statistical methods
Statistical methods can be important for understanding cancer progression, analyzing treatment outcomes, and identifying significant trends in large data sets. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have further impacted the field. AI algorithms can process larger amounts of patient data and identify patterns that may predict individual responses to treatment, personalizing therapeutic strategies.

Computational-AI
AI allows researchers to predict the behavior of individual cells with greater accuracy by integrating diverse types of patient data. AI-driven models can also identify mathematical equations that more precisely reflect tumor growth dynamics, helping researchers uncover relationships between various biological factors more quickly.

Persistence barcode,"In topological data analysis, a persistence barcode, sometimes shortened to barcode, is an algebraic invariant associated with a filtered chain complex or a persistence module that characterizes the stability of topological features throughout a growing family of spaces. Formally, a persistence barcode consists of a multiset of intervals in the extended real line, where the length of each interval corresponds to the lifetime of a topological feature in a filtration, usually built on a point cloud, a  graph, a  function, or, more generally, a simplicial complex or a chain complex. Generally, longer intervals in a barcode correspond to more robust features, whereas shorter intervals are more likely to be noise in the data. A persistence barcode is a complete invariant that captures all the topological information in a filtration. In algebraic topology, the persistence barcodes were first introduced by Sergey Barannikov in 1994 as the ""canonical forms"" invariants consisting of a multiset of line segments with ends on two parallel lines, and later, in geometry processing, by Gunnar Carlsson et al. in 2004.

Film session,"A film session involves the use of a 35 mm movie projector and/or VCR/DVD/DVR player to project images portrayed of a sporting event. The visual analysis of an upcoming game or previous game by the coaching staff with or without players. 
The term was coined by the NFL in reference to making a better defense or offense while preparing for the next Sunday opponent by choreographing the weaknesses shown by the game tape thus opening up the chances for more opportunities of success in the next game.
Film Session is also the name of an NFL Network television program exploring the depths of the massive NFL Films library showcasing many of its classic, modern and historical specials and documentaries chronicling the history of the American sport of football in the National football league.

Data-driven astronomy,"Astroinformatics is an interdisciplinary field of study involving the combination of astronomy, data science, machine learning, informatics, and information/communications technologies. The field is closely related to astrostatistics.
Data-driven astronomy (DDA) refers to the use of data science in astronomy. Several outputs of telescopic observations and sky surveys are taken into consideration and approaches related to data mining and big data management are used to analyze, filter, and normalize the data set that are further used for making Classifications, Predictions, and Anomaly detections by advanced Statistical approaches, digital image processing and machine learning. The output of these processes is used by astronomers and space scientists to study and identify patterns, anomalies, and movements in outer space and conclude theories and discoveries in the cosmos.

Background
Astroinformatics is primarily focused on developing the tools, methods, and applications of computational science, data science, machine learning, and statistics for research and education in data-oriented astronomy. Early efforts in this direction included data discovery, metadata standards development, data modeling, astronomical data dictionary development, data access, information retrieval, data integration, and data mining in the astronomical Virtual Observatory initiatives. Further development of the field, along with astronomy community endorsement, was presented to the National Research Council (United States) in 2009 in the astroinformatics ""state of the profession"" position paper for the 2010 Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey. That position paper provided the basis for the subsequent more detailed exposition of the field in the Informatics Journal paper Astroinformatics: Data-Oriented Astronomy Research and Education.
Astroinformatics as a distinct field of research was inspired by work in the fields of Geoinformatics, Cheminformatics, Bioinformatics, and through the eScience work of Jim Gray (computer scientist) at Microsoft Research, whose legacy was remembered and continued through the Jim Gray eScience Awards.
Although the primary focus of astroinformatics is on the large worldwide distributed collection of digital astronomical databases, image archives, and research tools, the field recognizes the importance of legacy data sets as well—using modern technologies to preserve and analyze historical astronomical observations. Some Astroinformatics practitioners help to digitize historical and recent astronomical observations and images in a large database for efficient retrieval through web-based interfaces. Another aim is to help develop new methods and software for astronomers, as well as to help facilitate the process and analysis of the rapidly growing amount of data in the field of astronomy.
Astroinformatics is described as the ""fourth paradigm"" of astronomical research. There are many research areas involved with astroinformatics, such as data mining, machine learning, statistics, visualization, scientific data management, and semantic science. Data mining and machine learning play significant roles in astroinformatics as a scientific research discipline due to their focus on ""knowledge discovery from data"" (KDD) and ""learning from data"".
The amount of data collected from astronomical sky surveys has grown from gigabytes to terabytes throughout the past decade and is predicted to grow in the next decade into hundreds of petabytes with the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and into the exabytes with the Square Kilometre Array. This plethora of new data both enables and challenges effective astronomical research. Therefore, new approaches are required. In part due to this, data-driven science is becoming a recognized academic discipline. Consequently, astronomy (and other scientific disciplines) are developing information-intensive and data-intensive sub-disciplines to an extent that these sub-disciplines are now becoming (or have already become) standalone research disciplines and full-fledged academic programs. While many institutes of education do not boast an astroinformatics program, such programs most likely will be developed in the near future.
Informatics has been recently defined as ""the use of digital data, information, and related services for research and knowledge generation"". However the usual, or commonly used definition is ""informatics is the discipline of organizing, accessing, integrating, and mining data from multiple sources for discovery and decision support."" Therefore, the discipline of astroinformatics includes many naturally-related specialties including data modeling, data organization, etc. It may also include transformation and normalization methods for data integration and information visualization, as well as knowledge extraction, indexing techniques, information retrieval and data mining methods.

Joaquim da Costa Ribeiro,"Joaquim da Costa Ribeiro (Rio de Janeiro, July 8th 1906 - July 29th, 1960) was a Brazilian physicist and university professor in Brazil. He discovered the thermodielectric effect, also known as the Workman-Reynolds in the US. Ribeiro was a member of the Brazilian Academy of Sciences and was the first Scientific Director of CNPq.
He is the father of anthropologist Yvonne Maggie and grandfather of movie author Ana Costa Ribeiro, who directed ""Termodielétrico"", a memoir film about him and his legacy.

Biography
Costa Ribeiro was born at his family's house, on Barão de Itapejipe street, 82, in what was then the federal district of Brazil. His parents were Antonio Marques da Costa Ribeiro and Maria Constança Alburquerque da Costa Ribeiro. His father and grandfather, after whom Joaquim was named, were judges. 
Costa Ribeiro studied in a Jesuit school called Santo Inácio, until 1923, enrolling in the National School of Engineering the next year at the University of Brazil.
Ten years later, he got tenure at the same university. In 1940, Costa Ribeiro started researching new methods to measure radioactivity, and later studied the production of electret using several dielectric materials
Costa Ribeiro observed that, during electret formation, electric current was unnecessary: the dielectric's natural freezing was enough to electrify the end material, provided that one of the cooling phases was solid.
The phenomenom was named ""thermodielectric effect"" by Costa Ribeiro and fully described by him in a 1944 article in the Annals of the Brazilian Academy of Sciences (ABC) that gathered siginificant attention at home and abroad. This marked the first physical phenomenom completely observed and described by a Brazilian researcher.
Two years later, he got a permanent position in general and experimental Physics at the National Philosophy College, at the same university.

Naming Controversy
In may 1950, six years after the complete description of the phenomenom, two american scientists, Everly J. Workman and Steve E. Reynolds, published an article on Physical Review describing the observation of the thermodielectric effect in ice and water, without acknowledging Costa Ribeiro's findings.
Despite attempts by the Brazilian scientific community to warn authors of the precedence, several papers still mention the thermodielectric effect as the ""Workman-Reynolds effect"".

Death
Costa Ribeiro died in July 29th, 1960 at 54 years of age, at the Casa de Saúde Santa Lúcia. He was survived by his nine children.

Awards
Costa RIbeiro received the Einstein Prize by the ABC. He was also the first Brazilian delegate of UN for the peaceful use of nuclear energy.

Antarctica,"Antarctica ( ) is Earth's southernmost and least-populated continent. Situated almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle and surrounded by the Southern Ocean (also known as the Antarctic Ocean), it contains the geographic South Pole. Antarctica is the fifth-largest continent, being about 40% larger than Europe, and has an area of 14,200,000 km2 (5,500,000 sq mi). Most of Antarctica is covered by the Antarctic ice sheet, with an average thickness of 1.9 km (1.2 mi).
Antarctica is, on average, the coldest, driest, and windiest of the continents, and it has the highest average elevation. It is mainly a polar desert, with annual precipitation of over 200 mm (8 in) along the coast and far less inland. About 70% of the world's freshwater reserves are frozen in Antarctica, which, if melted, would raise global sea levels by almost 60 metres (200 ft). Antarctica holds the record for the lowest measured temperature on Earth, −89.2 °C (−128.6 °F). The coastal regions can reach temperatures over 10 °C (50 °F) in the summer. Native species of animals include mites, nematodes, penguins, seals and tardigrades. Where vegetation occurs, it is mostly in the form of lichen or moss.
The ice shelves of Antarctica were probably first seen in 1820, during a Russian expedition led by Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev. The decades that followed saw further exploration by French, American, and British expeditions. The first confirmed landing was by a Norwegian team in 1895. In the early 20th century, there were a few expeditions into the interior of the continent. British explorers Robert Falcon Scott and Ernest Shackleton were the first to reach the magnetic South Pole in 1909, and the geographic South Pole was first reached in 1911 by Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen.
Antarctica is governed by about 30 countries, all of which are parties of the 1959 Antarctic Treaty System. According to the terms of the treaty, military activity, mining, nuclear explosions, and nuclear waste disposal are all prohibited in Antarctica. Tourism, fishing and research are the main human activities in and around Antarctica. During the summer months, about 5,000 people reside at research stations, a figure that drops to around 1,000 in the winter. Despite the continent's remoteness, human activity has a significant effect on it via pollution, ozone depletion, and climate change. The melting of the potentially unstable West Antarctic ice sheet causes the most uncertainty in century-scale projections of sea level rise, and the same melting also affects the Southern Ocean overturning circulation, which can eventually lead to significant impacts on the Southern Hemisphere climate and Southern Ocean productivity.

Etymology
The name given to the continent originates from the word antarctic, which comes from Middle French antartique or antarctique ('opposite to the Arctic') and, in turn, the Latin antarcticus ('opposite to the north'). Antarcticus is derived from the Greek ἀντι- ('anti-') and ἀρκτικός (arktikos, 'of the Bear [Ursa Major], northern'). The Greek philosopher Aristotle wrote in Meteorology about an ""Antarctic region"" in c. 350 BCE. The Greek geographer Marinus of Tyre reportedly used the name in his world map from the second century CE, now lost. The Roman authors Gaius Julius Hyginus and Apuleius used for the South Pole the romanised Greek name polus antarcticus, from which derived the Old French pole antartike (modern pôle antarctique) attested in 1270, and from there the Middle English pol antartik, found first in a treatise written by the English author Geoffrey Chaucer.
Belief by Europeans in the existence of a Terra Australis—a vast continent in the far south of the globe to balance the northern lands of Europe, Asia, and North Africa—had existed as an intellectual concept since classical antiquity. The belief in such a land lasted until the European discovery of Australia.
During the early 19th century, explorer Matthew Flinders doubted the existence of a detached continent south of Australia (then called New Holland) and thus advocated for the ""Terra Australis"" name to be used for Australia instead. In 1824, the colonial authorities in Sydney officially renamed the continent of New Holland to Australia, leaving the term ""Terra Australis"" unavailable as a reference to Antarctica. Over the following decades, geographers used phrases such as ""the Antarctic Continent"". They searched for a more poetic replacement, suggesting names such as Ultima and Antipodea. Antarctica was adopted in the 1890s, with the first use of the name being attributed to the Scottish cartographer John George Bartholomew.
Antarctica has also been known by the moniker Great White South, after which British photographer Herbert Ponting named one of his books on Antarctic photography, possibly as a counterpart to the epithet Great White North for Canada.

Continent,"A continent is any of several large geographical regions. Continents are generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria. A continent could be a single large landmass, a part of a very large landmass, as in the case of Asia or Europe within Eurasia, or a landmass and nearby islands within its continental shelf. Due to these varying definitions, the number of continents varies; up to seven or as few as four geographical regions are commonly regarded as continents. Most English-speaking countries recognize seven regions as continents. In order from largest to smallest in area, these seven regions are Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia (sometimes called Oceania or Australasia). Different variations with fewer continents merge some of these regions; examples of this are merging Asia and Europe into Eurasia, North America and South America into the Americas (or simply America), and Africa, Asia, and Europe into Afro-Eurasia.
Oceanic islands are occasionally grouped with a nearby continent to divide all the world's land into geographical regions. Under this scheme, most of the island countries and territories in the Pacific Ocean are grouped together with the continent of Australia to form the geographical region of Oceania.
In geology, a continent is defined as ""one of Earth's major landmasses, including both dry land and continental shelves"". The geological continents correspond to seven large areas of continental crust that are found on the tectonic plates, but exclude small continental fragments such as Madagascar that are generally referred to as microcontinents. Continental crust is known to exist only on Earth.
The idea of continental drift gained recognition in the 20th century. It postulates that the current continents formed from the breaking up of a supercontinent (Pangaea) that formed hundreds of millions of years ago.

Etymology
From the 16th century the English noun continent was derived from the term continent land, meaning continuous or connected land and translated from the Latin terra continens. The noun was used to mean ""a connected or continuous tract of land"" or mainland. It was not applied only to very large areas of land—in the 17th century, references were made to the continents (or mainlands) of the Isle of Man, Ireland and Wales and in 1745 to Sumatra. The word continent was used in translating Greek and Latin writings about the three ""parts"" of the world, although in the original languages no word of exactly the same meaning as continent was used.
While continent was used on the one hand for relatively small areas of continuous land, on the other hand geographers again raised Herodotus's query about why a single large landmass should be divided into separate continents. In the mid-17th century, Peter Heylin wrote in his Cosmographie that ""A Continent is a great quantity of Land, not separated by any Sea from the rest of the World, as the whole Continent of Europe, Asia, Africa."" In 1727, Ephraim Chambers wrote in his Cyclopædia, ""The world is ordinarily divided into two grand continents: the Old and the New."" And in his 1752 atlas, Emanuel Bowen defined a continent as ""a large space of dry land comprehending many countries all joined together, without any separation by water. Thus Europe, Asia, and Africa is one great continent, as America is another."" However, the old idea of Europe, Asia and Africa as ""parts"" of the world ultimately persisted with these being regarded as separate continents.

Definitions and application
By convention, continents ""are understood to be large, continuous, discrete masses of land, ideally separated by expanses of water"". By this definition, all continents have to be an island of some metric. In modern schemes with five or more recognized continents, at least one pair of continents is joined by land in some fashion. The criterion ""large"" leads to arbitrary classification: Greenland, with a surface area of 2,166,086 square kilometres (836,330 sq mi), is only considered the world's largest island, while Australia, at 7,617,930 square kilometres (2,941,300 sq mi), is deemed the smallest continent.
Earth's major landmasses all have coasts on a single, continuous World Ocean, which is divided into several principal oceanic components by the continents and various geographic criteria.
The geological definition of a continent has four criteria: high elevation relative to the ocean floor; a wide range of igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks rich in silica; a crust thicker than the surrounding oceanic crust; and well-defined limits around a large enough area.

Extent
The most restricted meaning of continent is that of a continuous area of land or mainland, with the coastline and any land boundaries forming the edge of the continent. In this sense, the term continental Europe (sometimes referred to in Britain as ""the Continent"") is used to refer to mainland Europe, excluding islands such as Great Br",Continents,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continent,1,continent several large geographical region continent generally identified convention rather strict criterion continent could single large landmass part large landmass case asia europe within eurasia landmass nearby island within continental shelf due varying definition number continent varies seven four geographical region commonly regarded continent englishspeaking country recognize seven region continent order largest smallest area seven region asia africa north america south america antarctica europe australia sometimes called oceania australasia different variation fewer continent merge region example merging asia europe eurasia north america south america america simply america africa asia europe afroeurasia oceanic island occasionally grouped nearby continent divide world land geographical region scheme island country territory pacific ocean grouped together continent australia form geographical region oceania geology continent defined one earth major landmass including dry land continental shelf geological continent correspond seven large area continental crust found tectonic plate exclude small continental fragment madagascar generally referred microcontinents continental crust known exist earth idea continental drift gained recognition th century postulate current continent formed breaking supercontinent pangaea formed hundred million year ago etymology th century english noun continent derived term continent land meaning continuous connected land translated latin terra continens noun used mean connected continuous tract land mainland applied large area land—in th century reference made continent mainland isle man ireland wale sumatra word continent used translating greek latin writing three part world although original language word exactly meaning continent used continent used one hand relatively small area continuous land hand geographer raised herodotus query single large landmass divided separate continent midth century peter heylin wrote cosmographie continent great quantity land separated sea rest world whole continent europe asia africa ephraim chamber wrote cyclopædia world ordinarily divided two grand continent old new atlas emanuel bowen defined continent large space dry land comprehending many country joined together without separation water thus europe asia africa one great continent america another however old idea europe asia africa part world ultimately persisted regarded separate continent definition application convention continent understood large continuous discrete mass land ideally separated expanse water definition continent island metric modern scheme five recognized continent least one pair continent joined land fashion criterion large lead arbitrary classification greenland surface area square kilometre sq mi considered world largest island australia square kilometre sq mi deemed smallest continent earth major landmass coast single continuous world ocean divided several principal oceanic component continent various geographic criterion geological definition continent four criterion high elevation relative ocean floor wide range igneous metamorphic sedimentary rock rich silica crust thicker surrounding oceanic crust welldefined limit around large enough area extent restricted meaning continent continuous area land mainland coastline land boundary forming edge continent sense term continental europe sometimes referred britain continent used refer mainland europe excluding island great br
Biomedical data science,"Biomedical data science is a multidisciplinary field which leverages large volumes of data to promote biomedical innovation and discovery. Biomedical data science draws from various fields including Biostatistics, Biomedical informatics, and machine learning, with the goal of understanding biological and medical data. It can be viewed as the study and application of data science to solve biomedical problems. Modern biomedical datasets often have specific features which make their analyses difficult, including:

Large numbers of feature (sometimes billions), typically far larger than the number of samples (typically tens or hundreds)
Noisy and missing data
Privacy concerns (e.g., electronic health record confidentiality)
Requirement of interpretability from decision makers and regulatory bodies
Many biomedical data science projects apply machine learning to such datasets. These characteristics, while also present in many data science applications more generally, make biomedical data science a specific field. Examples of biomedical data science research include: 

Computational genomics
Computational imaging
Electronic health records data mining
Biomedical network science

Training in Biomedical Data Science
The National Library of Medicine of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) identified key biomedical data scientist attributes in an NIH-wide review: general biomedical subject matter knowledge; programming language expertise; predictive analytics, modeling, and machine learning; team science and communication; and responsible data stewardship.

University Departments and Programs
Johns Hopkins University’s Department of Biomedical Engineering offers biomedical data science training at the undergraduate, master's, and PhD levels. They were the first university to offer programs at both undergraduate and graduate levels.
Dartmouth College's Geisel School of Medicine houses the Department of Biomedical Data Science where Quantitative Biomedical Sciences programs are available at the master's and PhD levels.
Imperial College London’s Faculty of Medicine and Data Science Institute offer an MRes in Biomedical Research (Data Science).
Mount Sinai’s Icahn School of Medicine offers a Master of Science in Biomedical Data Science.
Stanford University’s Department of Biomedical Data Science offers multiple biomedical informatics graduate programs (MS, PhD, and MD/PhD).
The University of Exeter’s College of Healthcare and Medicine offers an MSc in Health Data Science.

Biomedical Data Science Research in Academia
Scholarly Journals
The first journal dedicated to biomedical data science appeared in 2018 – Annual Review of Biomedical Data Science. “The Annual Review of Biomedical Data Science provides comprehensive expert reviews in biomedical data science, focusing on advanced methods to store, retrieve, analyze, and organize biomedical data and knowledge. The scope of the journal encompasses informatics, computational, and statistical approaches to biomedical data, including the sub-fields of bioinformatics, computational biology, biomedical informatics, clinical and clinical research informatics, biostatistics, and imaging informatics. The mission of the journal is to identify both emerging and established areas of biomedical data science, and the leaders in these fields.” 
Other journals have a more general scope than biomedical data science, but regularly publish biomedical data science research such as Health Data Science and Nature Machine Intelligence. Data science would not exist without curated datasets and the field has seen the rise of journals that are dedicated to describing and validating such datasets, some of which are useful for biomedical applications, including Scientific Data, Biomedical Data, and Data.

Example
The Human Genome Project (HGP), which uncovered the DNA sequences that compose human genes, would not have been possible without biomedical data science. Significant computational resources were required to process the data in the HGP, as the human genome contains over 6 billion DNA base pairs. Scientists constructed the genome by piecing together small fragments of DNA, and computing overlaps between these sequences alone required over 10,000 CPU hours. At this massive data scale, scientists relied on advanced algorithms to perform data processing steps such as sequence assembly and sequence alignment for quality control. Some of these algorithms, such as BLAST, are still used in modern bioinformatics. Scientists in the HGP also had to address complexities often associated with biomedical data including noisy data, such as DNA read errors, and privacy rights of the research subjects. The HGP, completed in 2004, has had immense impact both biologically, shedding light on human evolution, and medically, launching the field of bioinformatics and leading to technologies such as genetic screening and gene therapy.

Phoenician–Punic literature,"Phoenician–Punic literature is literature written in Phoenician, the language of the ancient civilization of Phoenicia, or in the Punic language that developed from Phoenician and was used in Ancient Carthage. It is surrounded by an aura of mystery due to the few preserved remains. All that is left is a series of inscriptions, few of which are of a purely literary nature (e.g. historical tales, poems, etc.), coins, fragments of Sanchuniathon's History and Mago's Treaty, the Greek translation of the voyage of Hanno the Navigator and a few lines in the Poenulus by Plautus.
However, it is a proven fact that both Phoenicia and Carthage had extensive libraries and that Phoenicians had a rich literary production inherited from their Canaanite past, of which works by Philo of Byblos and Menander of Ephesus are only a small part.

History and sources
The Jewish historian Flavius Josephus alludes to the Phoenician or Tyrian chronicles that he allegedly consulted to write his historical works. Herodotus also mentioned the existence of books from Byblos and a History of Tyre preserved in the temple of Hercules-Melqart in Tyre. In addition, it is possible to find some remnants of the influence exerted by certain writings of Ugarit in some biblical books, such as the Genesis or the Book of Ruth, that had traces of poetic compositions of religious or political themes – with a markedly propagandistic or philosophical undertone.
Rufius Festus Avienius also alludes to old Punic records from where he would have drawn his reports on the voyage of Himilco. Greco-Roman sources mention a number of Punic books saved from the looting and burning of Carthage by the legions of Scipio Africanus in the spring of 146 BC. In his work Natural History, Pliny indicates that after the fall of Carthage, many of these books were handed over to the Numidian rulers and the Roman Senate ordered their translation into Latin – specifically Mago's agricultural work, establishing a commission under the leadership of Decimus Junius Pison.

According to the Byzantine Encyclopedia called Suda, there was a historian of antiquity known as Charon of Carthage that wrote a collection of books: Lives of Illustrious Men, Lives of Illustrious Women, and Tyrants.
Augustine of Hippo (who lived between the 3rd and 4th centuries AD) considered Punic as one of the main ""sapiential"" languages, along with Hebrew, Canaanite, Latin and Greek. On Punic literature, he wrote:Quae lingua si improbatur abs te, nega Punicis Libris, ut a viris doctissimus proditur, multa sapienter esse mandata memoriae (English: If you reject this language, you are denying what many scholars have acknowledged: many things have been wisely preserved from oblivion thanks to books written in Punic.)To Augustine, this literature was not only ancient but also contemporary. He mentioned abecedaria and psalms composed in Punic and that both Donatists and Neo-Punic Catholics wrote ""little books in Punic"" with ""testimonies of the sacred scriptures"". An important part of the Bible is thought to have been translated into Neo-Punic.

Subjects
Agricultural treatises
This is one of the areas where the most information is available, since it is known that after the end of the Third Punic War, the Roman Senate decided to translate an encyclopedic treatise on agronomy written by Mago – considered by Columella as the father of agronomy – into Latin. This treatise comprised 28 books, of which 66 fragments have been preserved. It includes topics such as viticulture, topography, veterinary medicine, beekeeping, and fruit arboriculture, as well as recommendations defending the idea that the properties should not be too large and that the owner should not be absent.
Mago may not have been the only Carthaginian treatisist concerned with these topics, since Columella clearly indicates that there were several other writers focusing on the subject; however, he does not specify who they might have been or the depth of their work – with the exception of one Amilcar.

Philosophical writings
Philosophical works are likely to have been written even if there is little evidence, since it is known that in Carthage as well as in Gadir there were Platonic and Pythagorean schools, currents that seem to have been widely accepted in the colonial Phoenician sphere. We only know of works by Moderatus, of the Gaditan school, who wrote in Greek. A treatise on philosophy is attributed to Sanchuniathon – of which there is no record other than a simple mention.

Religious writings
The fragments of Sanchuniathon's work that have been preserved form the most extensive religious text on Phoenician mythology known to date. It is a kind of Theogony that includes passages on cosmogony, heroic tales, the life of the gods, and the use of rituals with snakes. There is also an allusion made by Plutarch in regards to a series of sacred scrolls rescued from Carthage and hidden underground, although the veracity of this information has not been confir",Literature,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenician%E2%80%93Punic_literature,0,phoenician–punic literature literature written phoenician language ancient civilization phoenicia punic language developed phoenician used ancient carthage surrounded aura mystery due preserved remains left series inscription purely literary nature eg historical tale poem etc coin fragment sanchuniathons history magos treaty greek translation voyage hanno navigator line poenulus plautus however proven fact phoenicia carthage extensive library phoenician rich literary production inherited canaanite past work philo byblos menander ephesus small part history source jewish historian flavius josephus alludes phoenician tyrian chronicle allegedly consulted write historical work herodotus also mentioned existence book byblos history tyre preserved temple herculesmelqart tyre addition possible find remnant influence exerted certain writing ugarit biblical book genesis book ruth trace poetic composition religious political theme – markedly propagandistic philosophical undertone rufius festus avienius also alludes old punic record would drawn report voyage himilco grecoroman source mention number punic book saved looting burning carthage legion scipio africanus spring bc work natural history pliny indicates fall carthage many book handed numidian ruler roman senate ordered translation latin – specifically magos agricultural work establishing commission leadership decimus junius pison according byzantine encyclopedia called suda historian antiquity known charon carthage wrote collection book life illustrious men life illustrious woman tyrant augustine hippo lived rd th century ad considered punic one main sapiential language along hebrew canaanite latin greek punic literature wrotequae lingua si improbatur ab te nega punicis libris ut viris doctissimus proditur multa sapienter esse mandata memoriae english reject language denying many scholar acknowledged many thing wisely preserved oblivion thanks book written punicto augustine literature ancient also contemporary mentioned abecedaria psalm composed punic donatist neopunic catholic wrote little book punic testimony sacred scripture important part bible thought translated neopunic subject agricultural treatise one area information available since known end third punic war roman senate decided translate encyclopedic treatise agronomy written mago – considered columella father agronomy – latin treatise comprised book fragment preserved includes topic viticulture topography veterinary medicine beekeeping fruit arboriculture well recommendation defending idea property large owner absent mago may carthaginian treatisist concerned topic since columella clearly indicates several writer focusing subject however specify might depth work – exception one amilcar philosophical writing philosophical work likely written even little evidence since known carthage well gadir platonic pythagorean school current seem widely accepted colonial phoenician sphere know work moderatus gaditan school wrote greek treatise philosophy attributed sanchuniathon – record simple mention religious writing fragment sanchuniathons work preserved form extensive religious text phoenician mythology known date kind theogony includes passage cosmogony heroic tale life god use ritual snake also allusion made plutarch regard series sacred scroll rescued carthage hidden underground although veracity information confir
Literature,"Literature is any collection of written work, but it is also used more narrowly for writings specifically considered to be an art form, especially novels, plays, and poems. It includes both print and digital writing. In recent centuries, the definition has expanded to include oral literature, much of which has been transcribed. Literature is a method of recording, preserving, and transmitting knowledge and entertainment. It can also have a social, psychological, spiritual, or political role.
Literary criticism is one of the oldest academic disciplines, and is concerned with the literary merit or intellectual significance of specific texts. The study of books and other texts as artifacts or traditions is instead encompassed by textual criticism or the history of the book. ""Literature"", as an art form, is sometimes used synonymously with literary fiction, fiction written with the goal of artistic merit, but can also include works in various non-fiction genres, such as biography, diaries, memoirs, letters, and essays. Within this broader definition, literature includes non-fictional books, articles, or other written information on a particular subject.
Developments in print technology have allowed an ever-growing distribution and proliferation of written works, while the digital era had blurred the lines between online electronic literature and other forms of modern media.

Definitions
Definitions of literature have varied over time. In Western Europe, prior to the 18th century, literature denoted all books and writing. It can be seen as returning to older, more inclusive notions, so that cultural studies, for instance, include, in addition to canonical works, popular and minority genres. The word is also used in reference to non-written works: to ""oral literature"" and ""the literature of preliterate culture"".
Etymologically, the term derives from Latin literatura/litteratura, ""learning, writing, grammar,"" originally ""writing formed with letters,"" from litera/littera, ""letter."" In spite of this, the term has also been applied to spoken or sung texts. Literature is often referred to synecdochically as ""writing,"" especially creative writing, and poetically as ""the craft of writing"" (or simply ""the craft""). Syd Field described his discipline, screenwriting, as ""a craft that occasionally rises to the level of art.""
A value judgment definition of literature considers it as consisting solely of high quality writing that forms part of the belles-lettres (""fine writing"") tradition. An example of this is in the 1910–1911 Encyclopædia Britannica, which classified literature as ""the best expression of the best thought reduced to writing"".

History
Oral literature
The use of the term ""literature"" here poses some issues due to its origins in the Latin littera, ""letter,"" essentially writing. Alternatives such as ""oral forms"" and ""oral genres"" have been suggested, but the word literature is widely used.
Australian Aboriginal culture has thrived on oral traditions and oral histories passed down through tens of thousands of years.
In a study published in February 2020, new evidence showed that both Budj Bim and Tower Hill volcanoes erupted between 34,000 and 40,000 years ago. Significantly, this is a ""minimum age constraint for human presence in Victoria"", and also could be interpreted as evidence for the oral histories of the Gunditjmara people, an Aboriginal Australian people of south-western Victoria, which tell of volcanic eruptions being some of the oldest oral traditions in existence. An axe found underneath volcanic ash in 1947 had already proven that humans inhabited the region before the eruption of Tower Hill.
Oral literature is an ancient human tradition found in ""all corners of the world."" Modern archaeology has been unveiling evidence of the human efforts to preserve and transmit arts and knowledge that depended completely or partially on an oral tradition, across various cultures:

The Judeo-Christian Bible reveals its oral traditional roots; medieval European manuscripts are penned by performing scribes; geometric vases from archaic Greece mirror Homer's oral style. (...) Indeed, if these final decades of the millennium have taught us anything, it must be that oral tradition never was the other we accused it of being; it never was the primitive, preliminary technology of communication we thought it to be. Rather, if the whole truth is told, oral tradition stands out as the single most dominant communicative technology of our species as both a historical fact and, in many areas still, a contemporary reality.
The earliest poetry is believed to have been recited or sung, employed as a way of remembering history, genealogy, and law.
In Asia, the transmission of folklore, mythologies as well as scriptures in ancient India, in different Indian religions, was by oral tradition, preserved with precision with the help of elaborate mnemonic techniques.
The early Buddhist texts are also generally believed to be of oral trad",Literature,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature,0,literature collection written work also used narrowly writing specifically considered art form especially novel play poem includes print digital writing recent century definition expanded include oral literature much transcribed literature method recording preserving transmitting knowledge entertainment also social psychological spiritual political role literary criticism one oldest academic discipline concerned literary merit intellectual significance specific text study book text artifact tradition instead encompassed textual criticism history book literature art form sometimes used synonymously literary fiction fiction written goal artistic merit also include work various nonfiction genre biography diary memoir letter essay within broader definition literature includes nonfictional book article written information particular subject development print technology allowed evergrowing distribution proliferation written work digital era blurred line online electronic literature form modern medium definition definition literature varied time western europe prior th century literature denoted book writing seen returning older inclusive notion cultural study instance include addition canonical work popular minority genre word also used reference nonwritten work oral literature literature preliterate culture etymologically term derives latin literaturalitteratura learning writing grammar originally writing formed letter literalittera letter spite term also applied spoken sung text literature often referred synecdochically writing especially creative writing poetically craft writing simply craft syd field described discipline screenwriting craft occasionally rise level art value judgment definition literature considers consisting solely high quality writing form part belleslettres fine writing tradition example – encyclopædia britannica classified literature best expression best thought reduced writing history oral literature use term literature pose issue due origin latin littera letter essentially writing alternative oral form oral genre suggested word literature widely used australian aboriginal culture thrived oral tradition oral history passed ten thousand year study published february new evidence showed budj bim tower hill volcano erupted year ago significantly minimum age constraint human presence victoria also could interpreted evidence oral history gunditjmara people aboriginal australian people southwestern victoria tell volcanic eruption oldest oral tradition existence axe found underneath volcanic ash already proven human inhabited region eruption tower hill oral literature ancient human tradition found corner world modern archaeology unveiling evidence human effort preserve transmit art knowledge depended completely partially oral tradition across various culture judeochristian bible reveals oral traditional root medieval european manuscript penned performing scribe geometric vas archaic greece mirror homer oral style indeed final decade millennium taught u anything must oral tradition never accused never primitive preliminary technology communication thought rather whole truth told oral tradition stand single dominant communicative technology specie historical fact many area still contemporary reality earliest poetry believed recited sung employed way remembering history genealogy law asia transmission folklore mythology well scripture ancient india different indian religion oral tradition preserved precision help elaborate mnemonic technique early buddhist text also generally believed oral trad
Mountain formation,"Mountain formation occurs due to a variety of geological processes associated with large-scale movements of the Earth's crust (tectonic plates).  Folding, faulting, volcanic activity, igneous intrusion and metamorphism can all be parts of the orogenic process of mountain building. The formation of mountains is not necessarily related to the geological structures found on it.
From the late 18th century until its replacement by plate tectonics in the 1960s, geosyncline theory was used to explain much mountain-building. The understanding of specific landscape features in terms of the underlying tectonic processes is called tectonic geomorphology, and the study of geologically young or ongoing processes is called neotectonics.

Types of mountains
There are five main types of mountains: volcanic, fold, plateau, fault-block, and dome. A more detailed classification useful on a local scale predates plate tectonics and adds to these categories.

Volcanic mountains
Movements of tectonic plates create volcanoes along the plate boundaries, which erupt and form mountains. A volcanic arc system is a series of volcanoes that form near a subduction zone where the crust of a sinking oceanic plate melts and drags water down with the subducting crust.

Most volcanoes occur in a band encircling the Pacific Ocean (the Pacific Ring of Fire), and in another that extends from the Mediterranean across Asia to join the Pacific band in the Indonesian Archipelago. The most important types of volcanic mountain are composite cones or stratovolcanoes and shield volcanoes.
A shield volcano has a gently sloping cone because of the low viscosity of the emitted material, primarily basalt. Mauna Loa is the classic example, with a slope of 4°-6°. (The relation between slope and viscosity falls under the topic of angle of repose.) A composite volcano or stratovolcano has a more steeply rising cone (33°-40°), because of the higher viscosity of the emitted material, and eruptions are more violent and less frequent than for shield volcanoes. Examples include Vesuvius, Kilimanjaro, Mount Fuji, Mount Shasta, Mount Hood and Mount Rainier.

Fold mountains
When plates collide or undergo subduction (that is, ride one over another), the plates tend to buckle and fold, forming mountains. While volcanic arcs form at oceanic-continental plate boundaries, folding occurs at continental-continental plate boundaries. Most of the major continental mountain ranges are associated with thrusting and folding or orogenesis. Examples are the Balkan Mountains, the Jura and the Zagros mountains.

Block mountains
When a fault block is raised or tilted, a block mountain can result. Higher blocks are called horsts, and troughs are called grabens. A spreading apart of the surface causes tensional forces. When the tensional forces are strong enough to cause a plate to split apart, it does so such that a center block drops down relative to its flanking blocks.
An example is the Sierra Nevada range, where delamination created a block 650 km long and 80 km wide that consists of many individual portions tipped gently west, with east facing slips rising abruptly to produce the highest mountain front in the continental United States.
Another example is the Rila–Rhodope massif in Bulgaria, including the well defined horsts of Belasitsa (linear horst), Rila mountain (vaulted domed shaped horst) and Pirin mountain—a horst forming a massive anticline situated between the complex graben valleys of the Struma and Mesta rivers.

Uplifted passive margins
Unlike orogenic mountains there is no widely accepted geophysical model that explains elevated passive continental margins such as the Scandinavian Mountains, eastern Greenland, the Brazilian Highlands, or Australia's Great Dividing Range.
Different elevated passive continental margins most likely share the same mechanism of uplift. This mechanism is possibly related to far-field stresses in Earth's lithosphere. According to this view elevated passive margins can be likened to giant anticlinal lithospheric folds, where folding is caused by horizontal compression acting on a thin to thick crust transition zone (as are all passive margins).

Models
Hotspot volcanoes
Hotspots are supplied by a magma source in the Earth's mantle called a mantle plume. Although originally attributed to a melting of subducted oceanic crust, recent evidence belies this connection. The mechanism for plume formation remains a research topic.

Fault blocks
Several movements of the Earth's crust that lead to mountains are associated with faults. These movements actually are amenable to analysis that can predict, for example, the height of a raised block and the width of an intervening rift between blocks using the rheology of the layers and the forces of isostasy. Early bent plate models predicting fractures and fault movements have evolved into today's kinematic and flexural models.

Line parent,"A peak's line parent is the closest higher peak on the highest ridge leading away from the peak's ""key col"".  A col is the lowest point on the ridge between two summits and is roughly synonymous with pass, gap, saddle and notch. The highest col of a peak is its key col. If there is more than one ridge which can be followed to a higher peak then the line parent is the peak closest to the key col. Usually, a line parent must meet some prominence criteria, which might vary depending on the author and the location of the peak.
There are at least two other kinds of peak parentage: island parentage, which is also referred to as encirclement or topographic parentage, and source parentage.

International expansion of Netflix,"Netflix is a video on demand service, which began expanding its business starting in 2010. The platform started in the United States and expanded for the first time in 2010, to Canada.  This marked the beginning of a long expansion process. By 2015, Netflix was operating in 50 countries. Today, Netflix is in over 190 countries, and has drastically increased their rate of expansion in the last five years. As of 2020, there were 203.67 million people paying for a Netflix subscription. Of those people, over 73 million are located in the United States.

Expansion timeline
In 2010, Netflix entered the international market by expanding into Canada. In 2011, Netflix began to expand more. From September 5 to September 12, 2011, Netflix began rolling out its services to over 40 countries in the Latin America and Caribbean regions. Netflix began its expansion into Europe in 2012.  By the end of that year, Netflix was streaming in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden. In 2013, Netflix launched in the Netherlands, and in 2014 Netflix continued its expansion further into Europe. Expansion to Australia and New Zealand occurred in March 2015. On February 4, 2015, expansion to Japan was announced to begin during the fall of 2015. On January 6, 2016 at Consumer Electronics Show, Netflix announced a major international expansion into 130 new territories (including most countries in Africa); with this expansion, the company promoted that its service would now be available nearly ""worldwide"", with the only notable exclusions including Mainland China, and regions subject to U.S. sanctions, such as China, North Korea, Russia and Syria. The company also announced a partnership with LG to market pre-paid services in Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. As of 2022, Netflix is streaming in over 190 countries, not including China, North Korea, Russia or Syria.

2010: Canada
Netflix entered the international market when they began offering their streaming service to Canada on September 22, 2010. At the time the subscription cost $7.99 a month, a rate that CEO Reed Hastings called, ""the lowest, most aggressive price we've ever had anywhere in the world."" However, despite the proclaimed low price, content selection in Canada was extremely limited. Data conducted in 2012 by Josh Loewen for Canadian Business Online found that in the United States there were 10,625 unique titles in Netflix's library, whereas in Canada there were only 2,647.  However, there is also content offered exclusively in Canada that is not available in the United States. For example, a short-lived Fox sitcom, Running Wilde starring Keri Russell and Will Arnett, began streaming on Canadian Netflix the same day it began airing in the United States on network television. The show streamed on Canadian Netflix because there was no Canadian broadcast partner for the series. Regardless of streaming selection, it took the company less than a year to reach one million subscribers, approximately three percent of Canada's population. As of February 2014, there were approximately 5.8 million Canadians using Netflix, or 29% of Canada's English-speaking population. This number represents an increase in Canadian users by approximately 40% since 2012.

2011: Latin America, Central America and Caribbean
On July 5, 2011, Netflix announced its plans to launch its streaming service in Latin America, its largest expansion to date. At the time, Netflix had 23 million subscribers in the US and Canada.  Entering the Latin American market meant Netflix had access to approximately 600 million people, or twice the number of people living in the United States. Although high speed internet in Latin America is not as accessible as it in the United States and Canada, upon the announcement of its expansion to Latin America, Netflix stock immediately surged 8%, bringing the company to a record share price of $291.
Beginning in September 2011, the company began its expansion to 43 countries and territories in Latin America and the Caribbean, offering content in English, Spanish, and Portuguese. Brazil became the first country in Latin America to launch the service on September 5. There the service was offered at $BR14.99 or approximately $9.10 per month, making it more expensive than in the United States and Canada. Rounding out the first five countries to launch streaming service in Latin America were Argentina, which followed on the 7th, Chile on the 8th, Colombia on the 9th, and Mexico on the 12th. Service spread to the other 38 countries in the following weeks. Among the content distributed to Latin America was programming from CBS, Miramax, and Showtime.
The launch in Latin America was not as successful as the company had hoped. While in Latin America, Netflix had no streaming competitors as it did in Canada, the digital divide (a lack of high broadband internet penetration) hindered rapid growth. In Brazil, for example, only 20% of the population had an internet spee",Netflix,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_expansion_of_Netflix,0,netflix video demand service began expanding business starting platform started united state expanded first time canada marked beginning long expansion process netflix operating country today netflix country drastically increased rate expansion last five year million people paying netflix subscription people million located united state expansion timeline netflix entered international market expanding canada netflix began expand september september netflix began rolling service country latin america caribbean region netflix began expansion europe end year netflix streaming united kingdom ireland denmark finland norway sweden netflix launched netherlands netflix continued expansion europe expansion australia new zealand occurred march february expansion japan announced begin fall january consumer electronics show netflix announced major international expansion new territory including country africa expansion company promoted service would available nearly worldwide notable exclusion including mainland china region subject u sanction china north korea russia syria company also announced partnership lg market prepaid service asia europe middle east netflix streaming country including china north korea russia syria canada netflix entered international market began offering streaming service canada september time subscription cost month rate ceo reed hastings called lowest aggressive price weve ever anywhere world however despite proclaimed low price content selection canada extremely limited data conducted josh loewen canadian business online found united state unique title netflixs library whereas canada however also content offered exclusively canada available united state example shortlived fox sitcom running wilde starring keri russell arnett began streaming canadian netflix day began airing united state network television show streamed canadian netflix canadian broadcast partner series regardless streaming selection took company less year reach one million subscriber approximately three percent canada population february approximately million canadian using netflix canada englishspeaking population number represents increase canadian user approximately since latin america central america caribbean july netflix announced plan launch streaming service latin america largest expansion date time netflix million subscriber u canada entering latin american market meant netflix access approximately million people twice number people living united state although high speed internet latin america accessible united state canada upon announcement expansion latin america netflix stock immediately surged bringing company record share price beginning september company began expansion country territory latin america caribbean offering content english spanish portuguese brazil became first country latin america launch service september service offered br approximately per month making expensive united state canada rounding first five country launch streaming service latin america argentina followed th chile th colombia th mexico th service spread country following week among content distributed latin america programming cbs miramax showtime launch latin america successful company hoped latin america netflix streaming competitor canada digital divide lack high broadband internet penetration hindered rapid growth brazil example population internet spee

Chemical reaction,"A chemical reaction is a process that leads to the chemical transformation of one set of chemical substances to another. When chemical reactions occur, the atoms are rearranged and the reaction is accompanied by an energy change as new products are generated. Classically, chemical reactions encompass changes that only involve the positions of electrons in the forming and breaking of chemical bonds between atoms, with no change to the nuclei (no change to the elements present), and can often be described by a chemical equation. Nuclear chemistry is a sub-discipline of chemistry that involves the chemical reactions of unstable and radioactive elements where both electronic and nuclear changes can occur.
The substance (or substances) initially involved in a chemical reaction are called reactants or reagents. Chemical reactions are usually characterized by a chemical change, and they yield one or more products, which usually have properties different from the reactants. Reactions often consist of a sequence of individual sub-steps, the so-called elementary reactions, and the information on the precise course of action is part of the reaction mechanism. Chemical reactions are described with chemical equations, which symbolically present the starting materials, end products, and sometimes intermediate products and reaction conditions.
Chemical reactions happen at a characteristic reaction rate at a given temperature and chemical concentration. Some reactions produce heat and are called exothermic reactions, while others may require heat to enable the reaction to occur, which are called endothermic reactions. Typically, reaction rates increase with increasing temperature because there is more thermal energy available to reach the activation energy necessary for breaking bonds between atoms.
A reaction may be classified as redox in which oxidation and reduction occur or non-redox in which there is no oxidation and reduction occurring. Most simple redox reactions may be classified as a combination, decomposition, or single displacement reaction.
Different chemical reactions are used during chemical synthesis in order to obtain the desired product. In biochemistry, a consecutive series of chemical reactions (where the product of one reaction is the reactant of the next reaction) form metabolic pathways. These reactions are often catalyzed by protein enzymes. Enzymes increase the rates of biochemical reactions, so that metabolic syntheses and decompositions impossible under ordinary conditions can occur at the temperature and concentrations present within a cell.
The general concept of a chemical reaction has been extended to reactions between entities smaller than atoms, including nuclear reactions, radioactive decays and reactions between elementary particles, as described by quantum field theory.

History
Chemical reactions such as combustion in fire, fermentation and the reduction of ores to metals were known since antiquity. Initial theories of transformation of materials were developed by Greek philosophers, such as the Four-Element Theory of Empedocles stating that any substance is composed of the four basic elements – fire, water, air and earth. In the Middle Ages, chemical transformations were studied by alchemists. They attempted, in particular, to convert lead into gold, for which purpose they used reactions of lead and lead-copper alloys with sulfur.
The artificial production of chemical substances already was a central goal for medieval alchemists. Examples include the synthesis of ammonium chloride from organic substances as described in the works (c. 850–950) attributed to Jābir ibn Ḥayyān, or the production of mineral acids such as sulfuric and nitric acids by later alchemists, starting from c. 1300. The production of mineral acids involved the heating of sulfate and nitrate minerals such as copper sulfate, alum and saltpeter. In the 17th century, Johann Rudolph Glauber produced hydrochloric acid and sodium sulfate by reacting sulfuric acid and sodium chloride. With the development of the lead chamber process in 1746 and the Leblanc process, allowing large-scale production of sulfuric acid and sodium carbonate, respectively, chemical reactions became implemented into the industry. Further optimization of sulfuric acid technology resulted in the contact process in the 1880s, and the Haber process was developed in 1909–1910 for ammonia synthesis.
From the 16th century, researchers including Jan Baptist van Helmont, Robert Boyle, and Isaac Newton tried to establish theories of experimentally observed chemical transformations. The phlogiston theory was proposed in 1667 by Johann Joachim Becher. It postulated the existence of a fire-like element called ""phlogiston"", which was contained within combustible bodies and released during combustion. This proved to be false in 1785 by Antoine Lavoisier who found the correct explanation of the combustion as a reaction with oxygen from the air.

Anabranch,"An anabranch is a section of a river or stream that diverts from the main channel or stem of the watercourse and rejoins the main stem downstream. Local anabranches can be the result of small islands in the watercourse. In larger anabranches, the flow can diverge for a distance of several or even hundreds of kilometers before rejoining the main channel.

Word usage and related terms
The term anabranch, in its hydrological meaning, is used more frequently  in Australia than in the rest of the English-speaking world.  
The term anabranching river describes a river with many anabranches, whilst an anastomosing river is an organic-rich subset of this river type.
The term braided river describes watercourses which are divided by small islands into multiple channel threads within a single main channel, but the term does not describe the multiple channels of an anabranching river.
A distributary is a branch of a river that does not rejoin the main channel; these are common on and near river deltas.
A bayou is often an anabranch.
An anabranch that gets cut off from the main channel becomes an oxbow lake, known in Australia as a billabong.

Examples
The Magdalena River, in Colombia, bifurcates in El Banco in two branches: Brazo de Loba (Shewolf Branch in Spanish) and Brazo de Mompox. The first one, Brazo de Loba is the main navigable channel and is 177 km long. Brazo de Mompox is thus the anabranch. There are several other branches that join those two main branches, interconnected by swamps (""ciénagas""), the main ones being Quitasol, Chicagua and La Victoria. Between Brazo de Loba and Brazo de Mompox is the island of Mompox or Margarita Island, a sunken geological block of 2.200 square km between the faults of Chicagua and El Romeral.
In the Fraser River delta of British Columbia, Canada, North Arm Fraser River, Middle Arm Fraser River, and  South Arm Fraser River each fall into Georgia Strait separately. On the other hand, Annacis Island splits (South Arm) Fraser River into the (main) Annieville Channel and the (smaller) Annacis Channel, which rejoin below the island.
In western New South Wales the Great Darling Anabranch is the ancestral path of the Darling River, dividing south of Menindee and extending for 460 km before joining the Murray River.  The anabranch contains flowing water only in wetter years.
In the Lower Simpson Desert, in South Australia, Kallakoopah Creek is an anabranch of the Warburton River that flows during major Warburton floods of over 5 m in depth. The Kallakoopah is approximately 400 km long and members of the Lake Eyre Yacht Club and others have used it to sail a circular route to Lake Eyre by traveling down the Kallakoopah and returning via the Warburton.
The Bahr el Zeraf in southern Sudan splits from the Bahr al Jabal section of the White Nile and flows for 240 km (150 mi), before rejoining the White Nile proper upriver from Malakal.
Approximately 15 km out of Charters Towers (Queensland/Australia) is a section of the Burdekin River known as 'the anabranch'. This strip of water is separate from the main flood way, and is typically dry during the sunnier months. Once there is consistent rain, it will meet up with the river again and flood with fresh water. It is well known for barramundi fishing.
Probably because waterways played an important role in infrastructure, anabranches and the resulting river islands are often found in old cities as with the Île de la Cité in Paris.

Participatory economics,"Participatory economics, often abbreviated parecon, is an economic system based on participatory decision making as the primary economic mechanism for allocation in society. In the system, the say in decision-making is proportional to the impact on a person or group of people. Participatory economics is a form of a socialist decentralized planned economy involving the collective ownership of the means of production. It is a proposed alternative to contemporary capitalism and centralized planning. This economic model is primarily associated with political theorist Michael Albert and economist Robin Hahnel, who describes participatory economics as an anarchist economic vision.
The underlying values that parecon seeks to implement are: equity, solidarity, diversity, workers' self-management, efficiency (defined as accomplishing goals without wasting valued assets), and sustainability. The institutions of parecon include workers' and consumers' councils utilising self-managerial methods for decision-making, balanced job complexes, remuneration based on individual effort, and wide decentralized planning. In parecon, self-management constitutes a replacement for the mainstream conception of economic freedom, which Albert and Hahnel argue by its very vagueness has allowed it to be abused by capitalist ideologues.
Albert and Hahnel claim that participatory economics has been practiced to varying degrees during the Russian Revolution of 1917, Spanish Revolution of 1936, and occasionally in South America.

Work and distribution
Balanced job complexes
A balanced job complex is a collection of tasks within a given workplace that is balanced for its equity and empowerment implications against all other job complexes in that workplace.

Compensation for effort and sacrifice (principle for distribution)
Albert and Hahnel argue that it is inequitable and ineffective to compensate people on the basis of luck (e.g. skills or talents that owe to their birth or heredity), or by virtue of workers' productivity (as measured by the value of the goods they produce). Therefore, the primary principle of participatory economics is to reward workers for their effort and sacrifice. Additionally, participatory economics would provide exemptions from the compensation for effort principle. 
The starting point for the income of all workers in a participatory economy is an equal share of the social product. From this point, incomes for personal expenditures and consumption rights for public goods can be expected to diverge by small degrees, reflecting the choices that individuals make in between work and leisure time, and the level of danger and difficulty of a job as judged by their immediate workplace peers.

Allocation of resource
Albert and Hahnel argue that decentralized planning can achieve Pareto optimum, and does so under less restrictive assumptions than free market models (see: the first fundamental theorem of welfare economics). Their model incorporates both public goods and externalities, whereas markets do not achieve Pareto optimality when including these conditions.

Facilitation boards
In a proposed participatory economy, key information relevant to converging on an economic plan would be made available by Iteration Facilitation Boards (IFBs), which, based on proposals from worker/consumer councils and economic data, present indicative prices and economic projections at each round of the planning process.
The IFB has no decision-making authority. In theory, the IFB's activity can consist mainly of computers performing the (agreed upon) algorithms for adjusting prices and forecasts, with little human involvement.

Motivations (opposition to central planning and capitalism)
Robin Hahnel has argued that ""participatory planning is not central planning"", stating ""The procedures are completely different and the incentives are completely different. And one of the important ways in which it is different from central planning is that it is incentive compatible, that is, actors have an incentive to report truthfully rather than an incentive to misrepresent their capabilities or preferences."" Unlike historical examples of central planning, the parecon proposal advocates the use and adjustment of price information reflecting marginal social opportunity costs and benefits as integral elements of the planning process. Hahnel has argued emphatically against Milton Friedman's a priori tendency to deny the possibility of alternatives:

Friedman assumes away the best solution for coordinating economic activities. He simply asserts ""there are only two ways of coordinating the economic activities of millions—central direction involving the use of coercion—and voluntary cooperation, the technique of the marketplace."" [...] a participatory economy can permit all to partake in economic decision making in proportion to the degree they are affected by outcomes.

Historic desertification,"Historic desertification is the study of the desert-forming process from a historic perspective. It was presumed in the past that the main causes of desertification lay in overuse of the land resulting in impoverishment of the soil, reduced vegetation cover, increased risk of drought and the resulting wind erosion. However recent projects to regreen deserts have not met with the success envisaged, and cast doubts on this theory. Research suggests that it is extreme events rather than drought caused by low annual precipitation, that do the most damage. Heavy downpours resulting in flash floods wash away sediment and there seems to have been an increased number of extreme events in the Levant at the end of the Byzantine period. The decline of settlements in the desert belt at this time may have been caused by these extreme events rather than a reduction in annual precipitation.

Causes of desertification
The Mediterranean and its transition zones to the deserts are characterized by impressive Roman and Byzantine ruins, which are subject of discussion as to how these cities came to be deserted. It was assumed that population growth or conquest by nomadic tribes led to over-exploitation of the land, leading to soil erosion and irreversible degradation. Reduced soil and vegetation cover led to reduced precipitation and advancing deserts.
However, failure of development aid projects raised doubts about the validity of the historic desertification issue. For example, a project aiming to reduce sedimentation and erosion at the King-Talal-dam close to Jerash in Jordan could not achieve its goals, which became clear when a heavy rainstorm led to massive sedimentation into the dam despite the newly constructed soil conservation devices. As well, the expected positive effects of the reforestation could not be observed. On the contrary, a high fire risk emerged since pine trees are easily flammable, and the grazing pressure was moved towards more sensitive areas in the desert belt. The evergreen trees also reduced groundwater recharge.

Research
A number of running research projects in Jordan found that the erosion of the main agricultural soil, the Terra Rossa, took place at the end of the last ice age and during the Younger Dryas. It seems therefore that erosion of the today's intensively used soils was limited during historical periods, and not connected with desertification.

The discussion about the impact of climate change on desertification focuses on drought. While some authors argue that periods of decline in the Levant were synchronous with reduced rainfall, others point to the non-linear development of settlement. However, a focus on annual precipitation allows only for limited conclusions about the productivity of agriculture. In this context, soils and colluvia point to an increased frequency of extreme rainfall events in the Levant at the end of the Byzantine period. As far as such events could be observed today, their associated damage was always enormous and could have had much more serious consequences than drought. The decline of settlement in the desert belt at the end of antiquity could be connected with an increase of extreme events.

Allotropy,"Allotropy or allotropism (from Ancient Greek  ἄλλος (allos) 'other' and  τρόπος (tropos) 'manner, form') is the property of some chemical elements to exist in two or more different forms, in the same physical state, known as allotropes of the elements. Allotropes are different structural modifications of an element: the atoms of the element are bonded together in different manners.
For example, the allotropes of carbon include diamond (the carbon atoms are bonded together to form a cubic lattice of tetrahedra), graphite (the carbon atoms are bonded together in sheets of a hexagonal lattice), graphene (single sheets of graphite), and fullerenes (the carbon atoms are bonded together in spherical, tubular, or ellipsoidal formations).
The term allotropy is used for elements only, not for compounds. The more general term, used for any compound, is polymorphism, although its use is usually restricted to solid materials such as crystals. Allotropy refers only to different forms of an element within the same physical phase (the state of matter, such as a solid, liquid or gas). The differences between these states of matter would not alone constitute examples of allotropy. Allotropes of chemical elements are frequently referred to as polymorphs or as phases of the element.
For some elements, allotropes have different molecular formulae or different crystalline structures, as well as a difference in physical phase; for example, two allotropes of oxygen (dioxygen, O2, and ozone, O3) can both exist in the solid, liquid and gaseous states. Other elements do not maintain distinct allotropes in different physical phases; for example, phosphorus has numerous solid allotropes, which all revert to the same P4 form when melted to the liquid state.

History
The concept of allotropy was originally proposed in 1840 by the Swedish scientist Baron Jöns Jakob Berzelius (1779–1848). The term is derived from Greek  άλλοτροπἱα (allotropia) 'variability, changeableness'. After the acceptance of Avogadro's hypothesis in 1860, it was understood that elements could exist as polyatomic molecules, and two allotropes of oxygen were recognized as O2 and O3. In the early 20th century, it was recognized that other cases such as carbon were due to differences in crystal structure.
By 1912, Ostwald noted that the allotropy of elements is just a special case of the phenomenon of polymorphism known for compounds, and proposed that the terms allotrope and allotropy be abandoned and replaced by polymorph and polymorphism. Although many other chemists have repeated this advice, IUPAC and most chemistry texts still favour the usage of allotrope and allotropy for elements only.

Differences in properties of an element's allotropes
Allotropes are different structural forms of the same element and can exhibit quite different physical properties and chemical behaviours. The change between allotropic forms is triggered by the same forces that affect other structures, i.e., pressure, light, and temperature. Therefore, the stability of the particular allotropes depends on particular conditions. For instance, iron  changes from a body-centered cubic structure (ferrite) to a face-centered cubic structure (austenite) above 906 °C, and tin undergoes a modification known as tin pest from a metallic form to a semimetallic form below 13.2 °C (55.8 °F). As an example of allotropes having different chemical behaviour, ozone (O3) is a much stronger oxidizing agent than dioxygen (O2).

List of allotropes
Typically, elements capable of variable coordination number and/or oxidation states tend to exhibit greater numbers of allotropic forms. Another contributing factor is the ability of an element to catenate.
Examples of allotropes include:

Non-metals
Metalloids
Metals
Among the metallic elements that occur in nature in significant quantities (56 up to U, without Tc and Pm), almost half (27) are allotropic at ambient pressure: Li, Be, Na, Ca, Ti, Mn, Fe, Co, Sr, Y, Zr, Sn, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Yb, Hf, Tl, Th, Pa and U. Some phase transitions between allotropic forms of technologically relevant metals are those of Ti at 882 °C, Fe at 912 °C and 1,394 °C, Co at 422 °C, Zr at 863 °C, Sn at 13 °C and U at 668 °C and 776 °C.

  Most stable structure under standard conditions.
  Structures stable below room temperature.
  Structures stable above room temperature.
  Structures stable above atmospheric pressure.

Lanthanides and actinides
Cerium, samarium, dysprosium and ytterbium have three allotropes.
Praseodymium, neodymium, gadolinium and terbium have two allotropes.
Plutonium has six distinct solid allotropes under ""normal"" pressures. Their densities vary within a ratio of some 4:3, which vastly complicates all kinds of work with the metal (particularly casting, machining, and storage). A seventh plutonium allotrope exists at very high pressures. The transuranium metals Np, Am, and Cm are also allotropic.

Chitra (art),"Chitra or citra is an Indian genre of art that includes painting, sketch and any art form of delineation. The earliest mention of the term Chitra in the context of painting or picture is found in some of the ancient Sanskrit texts of Hinduism and Pali texts of Buddhism.

Nomenclature
Chitra (IAST: Citra, चित्र) is a Sanskrit word that appears in the Vedic texts such as hymns 1.71.1 and 6.65.2 of the Rigveda. There, and other texts such as Vajasaneyi Samhita, Taittiriya Samhita, Satapatha Brahmana and Tandya Brahmana, Chitra means ""excellent, clear, bright, colored, anything brightly colored that strikes the eye, brilliantly ornamented, extraordinary that evokes wonder"". In the Mahabharata and the Harivamsa, it means ""picture, sketch, dilineation"", and is presented as a genre of kala (arts). Many texts generally dated to the post-4th-century BCE period, use the term Chitra in the sense of painting, and Chitrakara as a painter. For example, the Sanskrit grammarian Panini in verse 3.2.21 of his Astadhyayi highlights the word chitrakara in this sense. Halls and public spaces to display paintings are called chitrasalas, and the earliest known mention of these are found in the Ramayana and the Mahabharata.
A few Indian regional texts such as Kasyapa silpa refer to painting by others words. For example, abhasa – which literally means ""semblance, shining forth"",  is used in Kasyapa-shilpa to mean as a broader category of painting, of which chitra is one of three types. The verses in section 4.4 of the Kasyapa-silpa state that there are three types of images – those which are immovable (walls, floor, terracota, stucco), movable, and those which are both movable-immovable (stone, wood, gems). In each of these three, states Kasyapa-shipa, are three classes of expression – ardhacitra, citra, and citra-abhasa. Ardhacitra is an art form where a high relief is combined with painting and parts of the body is not seen (it appears to be emerging out of the canvas). The Citra is the form of picture artwork where the whole is represented with or without integrating a relief. Citrabhasha is the form where an image is represented on a canvas or wall with colors (painting). However, states Commaraswamy, the word Abhasa has other meanings depending on the context. For example, in Hindu texts on philosophy, it implies the ""field of objective experience"" in the sense of the intellectual image internalized by a person during a reading of a subject (such as an epic, tale or fiction), or one during a meditative spiritual experience.
In some Buddhist and Hindu texts on methods to prepare a manuscript (palm leaf) or a composition on a cloth, the terms lekhya and alekhya are also used in the context of a chitra. More specifically, alekhya is the space left while writing a manuscript leaf or cloth, where the artist aims to add a picture or painting to illustrate the text.

History
The earliest explicit reference to painting in an Indian text is found in verse 4.2 of the Maitri Upanishad where it uses the phrase citrabhittir or ""like a painted wall"". The Indian art of painting is also mention in a number of Buddhist Pali suttas, but with the modified spelling of Citta. This term is found in the context of either a painting, or painter, or painted-hall (citta-gara) in Majjhima Nikaya 1.127, Samyutta Nikaya 2.101 and 3.152, Vinaya 4.289 and others. Among the Jain texts, it is mentioned in Book 2 of the Acaranga Sutra as it explains that Jaina monk should not indulge in the pleasures of watching a painting.
The Kamasutra, broadly accepted to have been complete by about the 4th-century CE, recommends that the young man should surprise the girl he courts with gifts of color boxes and painted scrolls. The Viddhasalabhanjika – another Hindu kama- and kavya–text uses chitra-simile in  verse 1.16, as ""pictures painted by the god of love, with the brush of the mind and the canvas of the heart"".
The nature of a chitra (painting), how the viewer's mind projects a two dimensional artwork into a three dimensional representation, is used by Asanga in Mahayana Sutralamkara – a 3rd to 5th-century Sanskrit text of the Mahayana Buddhist tradition, to explain ""non-existent imagination"" as follows:

Just as in a picture painted according to rules, there are neither projections nor depressions and yet we see it in three dimensions, so in the non-existent imagination there is no phenomenal differentiation, and yet we behold it.
According to Yoko Taniguchi and Michiyo Mori, the art of painting the caves at the c. 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan site in Afghanistan, destroyed by the Taliban Muslims in the late 1990s, were likely introduced to this region from India along with the literature on early Buddhism.

Biliprotein,"Biliproteins are pigment protein compounds that are located in photosynthesising organisms such as algae, and sometimes also in certain insects. They refer to any protein that contains a bilin chromophore. In plants and algae, the main function of biliproteins is to make the process of light accumulation required for photosynthesis more efficient; while in insects they play a role in growth and development. Some of their properties: including light-receptivity, light-harvesting and fluorescence have made them suitable for applications in bioimaging and as indicators; while other properties such as anti-oxidation, anti-aging and anti-inflammation in phycobiliproteins have given them potential for use in medicine, cosmetics and food technology. While research on biliproteins dates back as far as 1950, it was hindered due to issues regarding biliprotein structure, lack of methods available for isolating individual biliprotein components, as well as limited information on lyase reactions (which are needed to join proteins with their chromophores). Research on biliproteins has also been primarily focused on phycobiliproteins; but advances in technology and methodology, along with the discovery of different types of lyases, has renewed interest in biliprotein research, allowing new opportunities for investigating biliprotein processes such as assembly/disassembly and protein folding.

Functions
In plants and algae
Biliproteins found in plants and algae serve as a system of pigments whose purpose is to detect and absorb light needed for photosynthesis.  The absorption spectra of biliproteins complements that of other photosynthetic pigments such as chlorophyll or carotene.  The pigments detect and absorb energy from sunlight; the energy later being transferred to chlorophyll via internal energy transfer. According to a 2002 article written by Takashi Hirata et al., the chromophores of certain phycobiliproteins are responsible for antioxidant activities in these biliproteins, and phycocyanin also possesses anti-inflammatory qualities due to its inhibitory apoprotein. When induced by both collagen and adenosine triphosphate (ADP), the chromophore phycocyanobilin suppresses platelet aggregation in phycocyanin, its corresponding phycobiliprotein.

In insects
In insects, biliprotein lipocalins generally function to facilitate the changing of colours during camouflage, but other roles of biliproteins in insects have also been found. Functions such as preventing cellular damage, regulating guanylyl cyclase with biliverdin, among other roles associated with metabolic maintenance, have been hypothesised but yet to be proven. In the tobacco hornworm, the biliprotein insecticyanin (INS) was found to play a crucial part in embryonic development, as the absorption of INS into the moth eggs was observed.

Structure
The structure of biliproteins is typically characterised by bilin chromophores arranged in linear tetrapyrrolic formation, and the bilins are covalently bound to apoproteins via thioether bonds. Each type of biliprotein has a unique bilin that belongs to it (e.g. phycoerythrobilin is the chromophore of phycoerythrin and phycocyanobilin is the chromophore of phycocyanin).  The bilin chromophores are formed by the oxidative cleavage of a haem ring and catalysed by haem oxygenases at one of four methine bridges, allowing four possible bilin isomers to occur.  In all organisms known to have biliproteins, cleavage usually occurs at the α-bridge, generating biliverdin IXα.
Phycobiliproteins are grouped together in separate clusters, approximately 40nm in diameter, known as phycobilisomes.  The structural changes involved in deriving bilins from their biliverdin IXα isomer determine the spectral range of light absorption.
The structure of biliproteins in insects differ slightly than those in plants and algae; they have a crystal structure and their chromophores are not covalently bound to the apoproteins. Unlike phycobiliproteins whose chromophores are held in an extended arrangement by specific interactions between chromophores and proteins, the chromophore in insect biliproteins has a cyclic helical crystal structure in the protein-bound state, as found in studies of the biliprotein extracted from the large white butterfly.

Classes of biliproteins
Phycobiliproteins
Phycobiliproteins are found in cyanobacteria (also known as blue-green algae) and algae groups such as rhodophyta (red algae) and cryptophytes. Major phycobiliproteins include variations of phycocyanin (blue-pigment), variations of phycoerythrin (red pigment), and allophycocyanin (light-blue pigment); each of them possessing different spectral properties.  These water-soluble biliproteins are not essential for the functioning of cells. Some special qualities of phycobiliproteins include antioxidant properties and high fluorescence, and it is their chromophores that give these proteins their strong pigment. Phycobiliproteins are classified into two categories b",Chemistry,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biliprotein,0,biliproteins pigment protein compound located photosynthesising organism algae sometimes also certain insect refer protein contains bilin chromophore plant algae main function biliproteins make process light accumulation required photosynthesis efficient insect play role growth development property including lightreceptivity lightharvesting fluorescence made suitable application bioimaging indicator property antioxidation antiaging antiinflammation phycobiliproteins given potential use medicine cosmetic food technology research biliproteins date back far hindered due issue regarding biliprotein structure lack method available isolating individual biliprotein component well limited information lyase reaction needed join protein chromophore research biliproteins also primarily focused phycobiliproteins advance technology methodology along discovery different type lyases renewed interest biliprotein research allowing new opportunity investigating biliprotein process assemblydisassembly protein folding function plant algae biliproteins found plant algae serve system pigment whose purpose detect absorb light needed photosynthesis absorption spectrum biliproteins complement photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll carotene pigment detect absorb energy sunlight energy later transferred chlorophyll via internal energy transfer according article written takashi hirata et al chromophore certain phycobiliproteins responsible antioxidant activity biliproteins phycocyanin also possesses antiinflammatory quality due inhibitory apoprotein induced collagen adenosine triphosphate adp chromophore phycocyanobilin suppresses platelet aggregation phycocyanin corresponding phycobiliprotein insect insect biliprotein lipocalins generally function facilitate changing colour camouflage role biliproteins insect also found function preventing cellular damage regulating guanylyl cyclase biliverdin among role associated metabolic maintenance hypothesised yet proven tobacco hornworm biliprotein insecticyanin in found play crucial part embryonic development absorption in moth egg observed structure structure biliproteins typically characterised bilin chromophore arranged linear tetrapyrrolic formation bilins covalently bound apoproteins via thioether bond type biliprotein unique bilin belongs eg phycoerythrobilin chromophore phycoerythrin phycocyanobilin chromophore phycocyanin bilin chromophore formed oxidative cleavage haem ring catalysed haem oxygenase one four methine bridge allowing four possible bilin isomer occur organism known biliproteins cleavage usually occurs αbridge generating biliverdin ixα phycobiliproteins grouped together separate cluster approximately nm diameter known phycobilisomes structural change involved deriving bilins biliverdin ixα isomer determine spectral range light absorption structure biliproteins insect differ slightly plant algae crystal structure chromophore covalently bound apoproteins unlike phycobiliproteins whose chromophore held extended arrangement specific interaction chromophore protein chromophore insect biliproteins cyclic helical crystal structure proteinbound state found study biliprotein extracted large white butterfly class biliproteins phycobiliproteins phycobiliproteins found cyanobacteria also known bluegreen algae algae group rhodophyta red algae cryptophyte major phycobiliproteins include variation phycocyanin bluepigment variation phycoerythrin red pigment allophycocyanin lightblue pigment possessing different spectral property watersoluble biliproteins essential functioning cell special quality phycobiliproteins include antioxidant property high fluorescence chromophore give protein strong pigment phycobiliproteins classified two category b
Profit (economics),"In economics, profit is the difference between revenue that an economic entity has received from its outputs and total costs of its inputs, also known as surplus value. It is equal to total revenue minus total cost, including both explicit and implicit costs.
It is different from accounting profit, which only relates to the explicit costs that appear on a firm's financial statements. An accountant measures the firm's accounting profit as the firm's total revenue minus only the firm's explicit costs. An economist includes all costs, both explicit and implicit costs, when analyzing a firm. Therefore, economic profit is smaller than accounting profit.
Normal profit is often viewed in conjunction with economic profit. Normal profits in business refer to a situation where a company generates revenue that is equal to the total costs incurred in its operation, thus allowing it to remain operational in a competitive industry. It is the minimum profit level that a company can achieve to justify its continued operation in the market where there is competition. In order to determine if a company has achieved normal profit, they first have to calculate their economic profit. If the company's total revenue is equal to its total costs, then its economic profit is equal to zero and the company is in a state of normal profit. Normal profit occurs when resources are being used in the most efficient way at the highest and best use. Normal profit and economic profit are economic considerations while accounting profit refers to the profit a company reports on its financial statements each period. 

Economic profits arise in markets which are non-competitive and have significant barriers to entry, i.e. monopolies and oligopolies. The inefficiencies and lack of competition in these markets foster an environment where firms can set prices or quantities instead of being price-takers, which is what occurs in a perfectly competitive market.
In a perfectly competitive market when long-run economic equilibrium is reached, economic profit would become non-existent, because there is no incentive for firms either to enter or to leave the industry.

Competitive and contestable markets
Companies do not make any economic profits in a perfectly competitive market once it has reached a long run equilibrium. If an economic profit was available, there would be an incentive for new firms to enter the industry, aided by a lack of barriers to entry, until it no longer existed. When new firms enter the market, the overall supply increases. Furthermore, these intruders are forced to offer their product at a lower price to entice consumers to buy the additional supply they have created and to compete with the incumbent firms (see Monopoly profit § Persistence). As the incumbent firms within the industry face losing their existing customers to the new entrants, they are also forced to reduce their prices. Therefore, increased competition reduces price and cost to the minimum of the long run average costs. At this point, price equals both the marginal cost and the average total cost for each good production. Once this has occurred a perfect competition exists and economic profit is no longer available. When this occurs, economic agents outside the industry find no advantage to entering the market, as there is no economic profit to be gained. Then, the supply of the product stops increasing, and the price charged for the product stabilizes, settling into an equilibrium.
The same is likewise true of the long run equilibria of monopolistically competitive industries, and more generally any market which is held to be contestable. Normally, a firm that introduces a differentiated product can initially secure  temporary market power for a short while (See Monopoly Profit § Persistence). At this stage, the initial price the consumer must pay for the product is high, and the demand for, as well as the availability of the product in the market, will be limited. In the long run however, when the profitability of the product is well established, and because there are few barriers to entry, the number of firms that produce this product will increase. Eventually, the supply of the product will become relatively large, and the price of the product will reduce to the level of the average cost of production. When this finally occurs, all economic profit associated with producing and selling the product disappears, and the initial monopoly turns into a competitive industry. In the case of contestable markets, the cycle is often ended with the departure of the former ""hit and run"" entrants to the market, returning the industry to its previous state, just with a lower price and no economic profit for the incumbent firms.
Economic profit can, however, occur in competitive and contestable markets in the short run, since short run economic profits attract new competitors and prices fall.

List of bodies of water by salinity,"This is a list of bodies of water by salinity that is limited to natural bodies of water that have a stable salinity above 0.05%, at or below which water is considered fresh.
Water salinity often varies by location and season, particularly with hypersaline lakes in arid areas, so the salinity figures in the table below should be interpreted as an approximate indicator.

Frenesy (physics),"Frenesy is a concept in statistical physics that measures the dynamical activity of a system's microscopic trajectories, particularly under nonequilibrium conditions. It complements the notion of entropy production, which measures time-antisymmetric aspects associated with irreversibility. Frenesy reflects how frequently states are visited or how many transitions occur over time and can be thought of as the ""busyness"" of the system's trajectories. It relates to reactivities, escape rates and residence times of a physical state.

Origin and context
The notion of frenesy was introduced in 2006 in the study of nonequilibrium processes by Christian Maes and collaborators, and has been discussed in various studies since then. In systems described by trajectory ensembles or path-space measures (e.g. originating in Markov processes or Langevin dynamics), frenesy is associated with the time-symmetric part of the action functional, containing trajectory-dependent terms such as escape rates, undirected traffic and the total number of configuration changes. As with many physical observables, it is the change in frenesy that makes the relevant quantity, particularly in the context of nonequilibrium response theory.
The role of dynamical activity in trajectory ensembles was explored in the study of large deviations. The specific need for dealing with the time-symmetric fluctuation sector was explained in an early influential paper. For some time, it was discussed under the name of ""traffic"", for example, in several studies on macroscopic fluctuations. A year later, in the context of response theory, the term ""frenetic"" appeared.
Mathematically, in a stochastic trajectory under local detailed balance, entropy production is tied to the asymmetry between forward and time-reversed paths, whereas frenesy quantifies the symmetric part invariant under time reversal. As such, it measures changes in dynamical activity or quiescence depending on the reference process and on the level of description.

Role in fluctuation-response
Frenesy is used in the generalization of fluctuation-dissipation relations beyond equilibrium. In nonequilibrium steady states, the linear response of an observable depends not only on the correlation with entropy production but also on correlations with frenesy. This correction has been proposed to describe response phenomena when systems are driven far from equilibrium.
As an extension of Kubo and Green-Kubo formulas, nonequilibrium linear response theory allows the response to be decomposed into an ""entropic"" term and a ""frenetic"" term. The frenetic component is absent in equilibrium but becomes significant under external driving forces. This is evident in nonequilibrium modifications of the Sutherland-Einstein relation, where mobility is no longer determined solely by the diffusion matrix of the unperturbed system but also includes force–current correlations. The frenetic contribution can lead to negative responses, such as for differential mobility or non-equilibrium specific heats. This phenomenon—often described as ""pushing more for getting less""—is supported by similar theoretical considerations. Frenetic effects also appear in second order and higher-order nonlinear response expansions around equilibrium.
A frenetic contribution also appears in corrections to the fluctuation-dissipation relation of the second kind, known as the Einstein relation. The (linear) friction has an entropic and frenetic part, where the entropic part connects with the noise in the usual equilibrium way. The frenetic part may be negative and dominating to the extent of rendering the friction negative.

Applications
The concept of frenesy is used in various areas of modern statistical physics. In the presence of dissipation, kinetic aspects in the form of increased or decreased dynamical activity and reactivities can determine a system's behavior. For example, jamming, localization, or glassy behavior are induced by dynamical heterogeneities where traps become important under driving or relaxation. Relaxation behavior is indeed another instance where kinetic aspects matter and where frenesy influences and shapes the landscape of possible pathways. Kinetic phase transitions are governed by large deviations in frenesy that signal transitions between dynamical phases. In active matter, persistent motion is triggered by switches (discrete or continuous) introducing high frenetic activity.
Other applications concern selection and steering. Kinetic proofreading and biological error correction are examples. The presence of driving allows changes in parameters governing dynamical activity to promote certain conditions of occupation and current. When those parameters depend on and receive feedback about the actual state, the system may evolve into a different phase or develop a dynamical pattern, as witnessed in active matter. As frenesy captures kinetic fluctuations and dynamical activity, its potential role has also been assessed",Physics,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenesy_(physics),0,frenesy concept statistical physic measure dynamical activity system microscopic trajectory particularly nonequilibrium condition complement notion entropy production measure timeantisymmetric aspect associated irreversibility frenesy reflects frequently state visited many transition occur time thought busyness system trajectory relates reactivity escape rate residence time physical state origin context notion frenesy introduced study nonequilibrium process christian maes collaborator discussed various study since system described trajectory ensemble pathspace measure eg originating markov process langevin dynamic frenesy associated timesymmetric part action functional containing trajectorydependent term escape rate undirected traffic total number configuration change many physical observables change frenesy make relevant quantity particularly context nonequilibrium response theory role dynamical activity trajectory ensemble explored study large deviation specific need dealing timesymmetric fluctuation sector explained early influential paper time discussed name traffic example several study macroscopic fluctuation year later context response theory term frenetic appeared mathematically stochastic trajectory local detailed balance entropy production tied asymmetry forward timereversed path whereas frenesy quantifies symmetric part invariant time reversal measure change dynamical activity quiescence depending reference process level description role fluctuationresponse frenesy used generalization fluctuationdissipation relation beyond equilibrium nonequilibrium steady state linear response observable depends correlation entropy production also correlation frenesy correction proposed describe response phenomenon system driven far equilibrium extension kubo greenkubo formula nonequilibrium linear response theory allows response decomposed entropic term frenetic term frenetic component absent equilibrium becomes significant external driving force evident nonequilibrium modification sutherlandeinstein relation mobility longer determined solely diffusion matrix unperturbed system also includes force–current correlation frenetic contribution lead negative response differential mobility nonequilibrium specific heat phenomenon—often described pushing getting less—is supported similar theoretical consideration frenetic effect also appear second order higherorder nonlinear response expansion around equilibrium frenetic contribution also appears correction fluctuationdissipation relation second kind known einstein relation linear friction entropic frenetic part entropic part connects noise usual equilibrium way frenetic part may negative dominating extent rendering friction negative application concept frenesy used various area modern statistical physic presence dissipation kinetic aspect form increased decreased dynamical activity reactivity determine system behavior example jamming localization glassy behavior induced dynamical heterogeneity trap become important driving relaxation relaxation behavior indeed another instance kinetic aspect matter frenesy influence shape landscape possible pathway kinetic phase transition governed large deviation frenesy signal transition dynamical phase active matter persistent motion triggered switch discrete continuous introducing high frenetic activity application concern selection steering kinetic proofreading biological error correction example presence driving allows change parameter governing dynamical activity promote certain condition occupation current parameter depend receive feedback actual state system may evolve different phase develop dynamical pattern witnessed active matter frenesy capture kinetic fluctuation dynamical activity potential role also assessed
Drainage density,"Drainage density is a quantity used to describe physical parameters of a drainage basin. First described by Robert E.

Drainage density depends upon both climate and physical characteristics of the drainage basin. Soil permeability (infiltration difficulty) and underlying rock type affect the runoff in a watershed; impermeable ground or exposed bedrock will lead to an increase in surface water runoff and therefore to more frequent streams. Rugged regions or those with high relief will also have a higher drainage density than other drainage basins if the other characteristics of the basin are the same.
When determining the total length of streams in a basin, both perennial and ephemeral streams should be considered. If a drainage basin contained only ephemeral streams, then the drainage density by the equation above would be calculated to be zero if the total length of streams was calculated using only perennial streams. Ignoring ephemeral streams in the calculations does not consider the behavior of the basin during flood events and is therefore not completely representative of the drainage characteristics of the basin.
Drainage density is indicative of infiltration and permeability of a drainage basin, and relates to the shape of the hydrograph. Drainage density depends upon both climate and physical characteristics of the drainage basin.
High drainage densities also mean a high bifurcation ratio.

Inverse of drainage density as a physical quantity
Drainage density can be used to approximate the average length of overland flow in a catchment. Horton (1945) used the following equation as an approximation to describe the average length of overland flow as a function of drainage density:

Lake stratification,"Lake stratification is the tendency of lakes to form separate and distinct thermal layers during warm weather. Typically stratified lakes show three distinct layers: the epilimnion, comprising the top warm layer; the thermocline (or metalimnion), the middle layer, whose depth may change throughout the day; and the colder hypolimnion, extending to the floor of the lake.
Every lake has a set mixing regime that is influenced by lake morphometry and environmental conditions. However, changes to human influences in the form of land use change, increases in temperature, and changes to weather patterns have been shown to alter the timing and intensity of stratification in lakes around the globe. Rising air temperatures have the same effect on lake bodies as a physical shift in geographic location, with tropical zones being particularly sensitive. These changes can further alter the fish, zooplankton, and phytoplankton community composition, in addition to creating gradients that alter the availability of dissolved oxygen and nutrients.

Definition
The thermal stratification of lakes refers to a change in the temperature at different depths in the lake, and is due to the density of water varying with temperature. Cold water is denser than warm water, and the epilimnion generally consists of water that is not as dense as the water in the hypolimnion. The temperature of maximum density for fresh water is 4 °C. In temperate regions where lake water warms up and cools through the seasons, a cyclical pattern of overturn occurs that is repeated from year to year as the cold dense water at the top of the lake sinks (see stable and unstable stratification). For example, in dimictic lakes the lake water turns over during the spring and the fall. This process occurs more slowly in deeper water; as a result, a thermal bar may form. If the stratification of water lasts for extended periods, the lake is meromictic.
Heat is transported very slowly between the mixed layers of a stratified lake: the diffusion of heat just one vertical meter takes about a month. The interaction between the atmosphere and lakes depends on how solar radiation is distributed, which is why water turbulence, mainly caused by wind stress, can greatly increase the efficiency of heat transfer. In shallow lakes, stratification into epilimnion, metalimnion, and hypolimnion often does not occur, as wind or cooling causes regular mixing throughout the year. These lakes are called polymictic. There is not a fixed depth that differentiates polymictic and stratifying lakes, as this is also influenced by turbidity, lake surface area, and climate.
The lake mixing regime (e.g. polymictic, dimictic, meromictic) describes the yearly patterns of lake stratification that occur in most years. However, short-term events can influence lake stratification as well. Heat waves can cause periods of stratification in otherwise mixed, shallow lakes, while mixing events, such as storms or large river discharge, can break down stratification. Weather conditions induce a more rapid response in larger, shallower lakes, so these lakes are more dynamic and less well understood. However, mixing regimes that are known to exist in large, shallow lakes are mostly diurnal, and the stratification is easily disturbed. Lake Taihu in China is an example of a large, shallow, diurnal lake, where even though the depth does not reach more than 3 meters (10 ft), the lake's water turbidity is still dynamic enough to stratify and de-stratify due to the absorption of solar radiation, mostly in the upper layer. The tendency for stratification to become disrupted affects the rate of transport and consumption of nutrients, in turn affecting the presence of algal growth. Stratification and mixing regimes in Earth's largest lakes are also poorly understood, yet changes in thermal distributions, such as the rising temperatures found over time in Lake Michigan's deep waters, can significantly alter the largest freshwater ecosystems on the planet. 
Recent research suggests that seasonally ice-covered dimictic lakes may be described as ""cryostratified"" or ""cryomictic"" according to their wintertime stratification regimes. Cryostratified lakes exhibit inverse stratification near the ice surface, and have depth-averaged temperatures near 4 °C, while cryomictic lakes have no under-ice thermocline and have depth-averaged winter temperatures closer to 0 °C.
Water circulation during mixing periods causes the movement of oxygen and other dissolved nutrients, distributing them throughout the body of water. In lakes where benthic organisms are prominent, the respiration and consumption of these bottom-feeders may outweigh the mixing properties of strongly stratified lakes, resulting in zones of extremely low near-bottom oxygen and nutrient concentrations. This can be harmful to benthic organisms such as shellfish; in the worst cases it can wipe out entire populations.

Massif,"A massif () is a principal mountain mass, such as a compact portion of a mountain range, containing one or more summits (e.g. France's Massif Central). In mountaineering literature, massif is frequently used to denote the main mass of an individual mountain.
As a purely scientific term in geology, however, a ""massif"" is separately and more specifically defined as a section of a planet's crust that is demarcated by faults or flexures. In the movement of the crust, a massif tends to retain its internal structure while being displaced as a whole. A massif is a smaller structural unit than a tectonic plate and is considered the fourth-largest driving force in geomorphology.
The word ""massif"" originates from French (in which the word also means ""massive""), where it is used to refer to a large mountain mass or compact group of connected mountains forming an independent portion of a range. The Face on Mars is an example of an extraterrestrial massif. Massifs may also form underwater, as with the Atlantis Massif.

Hospital Island (St. Andrews),"Hospital Island (previously Little Hardwood Island) is a small three-acre (12,000 m2) island in the Passamaquoddy Bay located northeast of Saint Andrews, New Brunswick. In 1842 it was established as a quarantine port for newcomers to the region, predominantly Irish emigres fleeing the potato famine, with an estimated 400 patients having died on the island. The buildings and burial ground spread over 20% of the island's surface.

Quarantine station
In 1832, a ship offloaded newcomers with Asiatic Cholera, leading to the demand for a quarantine island to be transferred to the Justices of Charlotte. On April 11–12, the Sessions of Charlotte County passed the resolution the island would be made a quarantine station and to finish construction on ""the pest house"" extant on the island. By May 1, the brig Susan put ashore to quarantine its Irish newcomers. At this time, the concern was smallpox.
In 1841, Boyd brought a petition from James Allanshaw seeking to authorise the sale of Hospital Island and a new piece of land purchased for a hospital.
When typhus became the main concern, by February 1842, a ship of European immigrants brought an epidemic of cholera, highlighting the need for a new quarantine station. Officials were further concerned since the local population depended on the many islands in the bay for their livelihood, and an earlier scare with cholera eight years earlier had seen the much larger 130-acre (0.53 km2) Navy Island, then dubbed Saint Andrews Island, transmit the disease to the mainland. Little Hardwood Island, as Hospital Island was then known, was chosen for being distant from the mainland and of no apparent use, with the island having been dubbed a ""miserable lump of reddish sand"" and ""the most worthless island"" in the area at the time. Its trees were cut, and the first facility built which measured 49 by 26 feet (15 by 8 m).

On June 3 1847, the Elizabeth Grimmer was ordered to hold her 229 passengers at Hospital Island,
In July 1847, the ship Magna Charta disembarked its passengers at Hospital Island, and the St. Andrews Standard reported that of 77 passengers, 10 had managed to escape the ship, 30 were sick with cholera, and two adults and two children had recently died. A second, larger, facility on the island was also built in 1847 which was 59 by 26 feet (18 by 8 m) and two storeys plus a basement. A separate home was built for the island doctor, an island keeper's residence, a shed and it was furnished with a sailboat for their use. The original structure was relegated to overflow usage during busy summer months. Dr. Samuel Frye, who had been involved with the earlier failed quarantine station at Navy Island and also ran a quarry on Cailiff Island, died serving at Hospital Island in 1847. 
In 1848, Margaret Baldwin, the widow of Thomas Baldwin, and Margaret Tufts, the widow of Benjamin Tufts, made successful petitions to the New Brunswick courts for financial assistance as their husbands had been employed on the island and died of typhus. In 1848, the barque Star again landed its Irish emigrants on Hospital Island, where 48 of them died and were buried. The chief Emigration Officer James Boyd travelled to the island in August 1848 to ""break up the establishment at Hospital Island"", taking away the final twelve residents  to stay at a nearby farm.
The Susan brought Irish emigres in 1849 and 1850.
In 1857, the Health Board again petitioned to close the Hospital Island station and purchase more suitable land on a different island to serve as quarantine. In 1859, the island's chief keeper Lachlan Hanlyn died of jaundice.
In 1865, the Saint Croix Courier reported that the steamship Atlantic, arriving from Brest, France, saw 50 to 60 cholera cases develop on Hospital Island wherein 15 died.
Hospital Island was viewed but not visited, for the 1870 geological survey of the region.

Legacy

In 1995, a stone Celtic cross memorial facing Hospital Island was erected on the mainland Saint Andrews, as a tribute to the Irish immigrants who died while being quarantined there. It is unclear whether the island has been used as a burial site for patients who died during quarantine.
By 1997, the island had been privately owned by George Matthews who, as well as cultural association members, had previously failed to find human remains. No portion of the historic buildings remain, and the island is now privately operated as a bird sanctuary.

Geo-literacy,"As defined by National Geographic, geo-literacy is ""the ability to use geographic understanding and geographic reasoning to make decisions"".

History
The term ""geo-literacy"" arose from the National Geographic Society's ""Fight against Geographic Illiteracy."" The organization released various media to help explain the concept to the general public. In an editorial, Daniel C. Edelson, vice president for education at National Geographic, said, ""The National Geographic Society's concern for geo-literacy comes from our mission. We see geo-literacy as providing the tools that will enable communities to protect natural and cultural resources, reduce violent conflict, and improve the quality of life worldwide. However, having a geo-literate populace is also critical for maintaining economic competitiveness, quality of life, and national security in our modern, interconnected world."", and have released various media to help explain it to the general public. In addition, the National Geographic Society set up the Fund for Geo-literacy, in which donations help fund the printing of materials for education, professional development for the educators, and programs to help build awareness of the importance of geo-literacy.

Components
According to Edelson, the three components of geo-literacy are:

Interactions: understanding of human and natural systems
Interconnections: geographic reasoning
Implications: systematic decision-making

Educational activities
Kid World Citizen is a website which provides ""multicultural, educational activities to teach...kids about the world"", and lists the following ""age-appropriate lessons to increase geo-literacy in primary school students"":

Explore different homes around the world and guess why the types of home fit their environment
Discover why certain cultures celebrate certain holidays, and what is important to them
Investigate different habitats and biomes, such as the rainforest; look at tangible ways children can prevent their destruction
Surround kids with geography: study maps, create maps, follow maps, play with maps. The more spatial intelligence is developed at a young age, the more children will understand their place in this world.
Learn about the water cycle and the conserving and managing freshwater resources
Research a child's favorite animal, turning it into a global lesson about protecting their habitat and food sources; what decisions can be made that will affect the outcome of this animal?

Research studies and education projects
In 2012, InTeGrate (""a community effort to improve geoscience literacy and build a workforce that can make use of geoscience to solve societal issues"") held a Module Author Meeting from May 16–18 on the topic.

Earlier uses of the term
In 2002, Robert E. Nolan of the Education Resources Information Center published a research report/journal article entitled ""Geo-Literacy: How Well Adults Understand the World in Which They Live"", which included  ""a test of physical and geopolitical geography...completed by 321 adults"". The years of formal education and age were correlated with geographic literacy, and informal learning, such as travel, reading, media, was used as the primary source of geographic knowledge for those with higher educational attainment. A notable finding was that women, regardless of education level, scored significantly lower than men.""
In 2001, the Arizona Geographic Alliance launched a project called The GeoLiteracy Project that integrated geography education into reading and writing instruction.  In this case, their term GeoLiteracy referred to the integration of geography and traditional language arts literacy.
In 1997, Linda Ferguson and Eva LaMar established an educational project they called The Geo-Literacy Project.  LaMar describes geo-literacy as ""the use of visual learning and communication tools to build an in-depth understanding -- or literacy -- of geography, geology, and local history.""

These include small but growing populations, limited resources, remoteness, susceptibility to natural disasters, vulnerability to external shocks, excessive dependence on international trade, and fragile environments. Their growth and development are also held back by high communication, energy and transportation costs, irregular international transport volumes, disproportionately expensive public administration and infrastructure due to their small size, and little to no opportunity to create economies of scale. They consist of some of the most vulnerable countries to anthropogenic climate change. 
The SIDS were first recognized as a distinct group of developing countries at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in June 1992. The Barbados Programme of Action was produced in 1994 to assist the SIDS in their sustainable development efforts. The United Nations Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States (UN-OHRLLS) represents the group of states.

List of SIDS
As of 2023, the United Nations Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States (UN-OHRLLS) lists 57 such nations (39 sovereign states and 18 dependent territories). These nations are grouped into three geographical regions: the Caribbean; the Pacific; and Africa, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean and South China Sea (AIMS), including 18 Associate Members of the United Nations Regional Commissions. Each of these regions has a regional cooperation body: the Caribbean Community, the Pacific Islands Forum, and the Indian Ocean Commission respectively, which many SIDS are members or associate members of. In addition, most (but not all) SIDS are members of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), which performs lobbying and negotiating functions for the SIDS within the United Nations System.

Impacts of climate change
The SIDS are some of the regions most vulnerable to anthropogenic climate change. Due to their oceanic environment, SIDS are especially vulnerable to the marine effects of climate change like sea level rise, ocean acidification, marine heatwaves, and the increase in cyclone intensity. Changing precipitation patterns could also cause droughts. Many citizens of SIDS live near a coastline, meaning that they have a high risk exposure to the effects of marine climate change. Additional climate change vulnerability comes through their economies: many SIDS have economies that are based on natural resources, such as ecotourism, fishing, or agriculture. Phenomena like sea level rise, coastal erosion, and severe storms have the potential to severely impact their economies.
In addition to these vulnerabilities, the energy sector in SIDS faces unique challenges and opportunities, particularly in the least-electrified regions. According to the March 2024 IRENA report, ""Small Island Developing States at a Crossroads: Towards Equitable Energy Access in Least-Electrified Countries,"" these states, which contribute less than 1% to global greenhouse gas emissions, are exploring decentralized renewable energy solutions to address their energy access issues. Technologies such as biomass gasification, small-scale hydro, and solar PV not only offer paths to reduce their carbon footprint but also enhance resilience against climate impacts. The report highlights case studies from Guinea-Bissau, Papua New Guinea, and Vanuatu, showing significant socio-economic benefits from improved energy access, including increased income opportunities for rural women and reduced indoor air pollution. These advancements are crucial as they not only provide immediate relief but also contribute to long-term sustainability and resilience against future climate challenges.""

Sustainable Development Goals
Small island developing states are mentioned in several of the Sustainable Development Goals. For example, Target 7 of Sustainable Development Goal 14 (""Life below Water"") states: ""By 2030, increase the economic benefits to small island developing States and least developed countries from the sustainable use of marine resources, including through sustainable management of fisheries, aquaculture and tourism"".
Several Small Island Developing States (SIDS), including Palau and Orkney, have launched renewable energy initiatives to improve energy efficiency and reduce reliance on fossil fuels; Palau has set a target of transitioning to 45% renewable energy by 2025, while Orkney is expanding its use of tidal turbines to create a 50 MW array.

Conservation and restoration of paintings,"The conservation and restoration of paintings is carried out by professional painting conservators. Paintings cover a wide range of various mediums, materials, and their supports (i.e. the painted surface made from fabric, paper, wood panel, fabricated board, or other). Painting types include fine art to decorative and functional objects spanning from acrylics, frescoes, and oil paint on various surfaces, egg tempera on panels and canvas, lacquer painting, water color and more. Knowing the materials of any given painting and its support allows for the proper restoration and conservation practices. All components of a painting will react to its environment differently, and impact the artwork as a whole. These material components along with collections care (also known as preventive conservation) will determine the longevity of a painting. The first steps to conservation and restoration is preventive conservation followed by active restoration with the artist's intent in mind.

Basic care
Typical, traditional oil, acrylic, and many other types of paintings are made up of various different types of materials, from their paint layers to the materials that make up their supports. Each of these materials requires specific care in handling, displaying, storage, added protective measures, and general environmental conditions. Providing the proper care to each of these materials ensures that the overall condition of the painting is protected.

Backing boards
Using good protective measures such as attaching a rigid backing to a painting on canvas provides several protections. It reduces the effects of rapid changes in relative humidity around the painting, provides some protection from pressure or direct contact against the canvas back, and protects from vibrations caused by handling or moving. Backing boards also serve to protect from dust and dirt, cracks and deformations from handling, and insect activity. Some of the most commonly used types of backing boards include foam core, heritage board, matboard, cardboard/millboard, coroplast, corrugated plastic sheets, acrylic sheeting, mylar, and fabric.

Framing
The frames around paintings are not just for aesthetic appearances. Frames are also used to protect the more sensitive parts of a painting when handled by hand, and they reduce the potential for damage if the painting is dropped. There are also specialists that work on the conservation and restoration of painting frames.

Handling and moving
The movement of objects places an object at a much greater risk of damage than when it is on display or in storage. Certain techniques and equipment are used any time an art work needs to be transported. These techniques and equipment include using padding lifts and dollies, moving small, fragile objects on carts instead of carrying by hand; lifting objects from underneath by their sturdiest part; and taking extra time and care when on ladders or stairs. In many cases gloves are worn to protect the art work from any dirt or oil that may be on a conservator or object handlers hands. When handling canvas paintings specifically, never presume that the frame is stable and firmly attached. Do not lift or carry a painting by its stretcher bar, or insert your fingers between the stretcher bar and the canvas

Display and storage
It is estimated that a lack of proper routine maintenance and care is responsible for 95 percent of conservation treatments; the remaining 5 percent results from mishandling objects When developing display and storage methods for works of art, issues regarding relative humidity, temperature, light, pollutants, and pests need to be considered. Location and the types of storage units must be considered as well. Storage areas should be located in areas away from pipes and heating systems, as well as out of areas that are likely to flood and collect dust and dirt. Storage units should be sturdy, adjustable for collections growth so all collections sizes are safely stored, made of materials that will not cause any damage to the paintings (i.e. metal racks), and be free of any hardware or supports that stick out.

Causes of deterioration
Moisture, heat, light, pollutants, and pests can slowly or suddenly cause damage to a painting. These agents of deterioration impact all of the components that make up a painting in various ways.

Accidents
Acts of vandalism / defacing / iconoclasty
People have damaged or destroyed artwork during war and peacetime. For example, during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, Saddam Hussein abused women, stole cars, damaged buildings and artwork. Another example is the destruction of paintings by political activists.

Inherent chemical degradations / Materials obsolescence and incompatibility
Mold
Relative humidity and temperature

Effects of climate change on oceans,"There are many effects of climate change on oceans. One of the most important is an increase in ocean temperatures. More frequent marine heatwaves are linked to this. The rising temperature contributes to a rise in sea levels due to the expansion of water as it warms and the melting of ice sheets on land. Other effects on oceans include sea ice decline, reducing pH values and oxygen levels, as well as increased ocean stratification. All this can lead to changes of ocean currents, for example a weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). The main cause of these changes are the emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities, mainly burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. Carbon dioxide and methane are examples of greenhouse gases. The additional greenhouse effect leads to ocean warming because the ocean takes up most of the additional heat in the climate system. The ocean also absorbs some of the extra carbon dioxide that is in the atmosphere. This causes the pH value of the seawater to drop. Scientists estimate that the ocean absorbs about 25% of all human-caused CO2 emissions. 
The various layers of the oceans have different temperatures. For example, the water is colder towards the bottom of the ocean. This temperature stratification will increase as the ocean surface warms due to rising air temperatures.: 471  Connected to this is a decline in mixing of the ocean layers, so that warm water stabilises near the surface. A reduction of cold, deep water circulation follows. The reduced vertical mixing makes it harder for the ocean to absorb heat. So a larger share of future warming goes into the atmosphere and land. One result is an increase in the amount of energy available for tropical cyclones and other storms. Another result is a decrease in nutrients for fish in the upper ocean layers. These changes also reduce the ocean's capacity to store carbon. At the same time, contrasts in salinity are increasing. Salty areas are becoming saltier and fresher areas less salty. 
Warmer water cannot contain the same amount of oxygen as cold water. As a result, oxygen from the oceans moves to the atmosphere. Increased thermal stratification may reduce the supply of oxygen from surface waters to deeper waters. This lowers the water's oxygen content even more. The ocean has already lost oxygen throughout its water column. Oxygen minimum zones are increasing in size worldwide.: 471 
These changes harm marine ecosystems, and this can lead to biodiversity loss or changes in species distribution. This in turn can affect fishing and coastal tourism. For example, rising water temperatures are harming tropical coral reefs. The direct effect is coral bleaching on these reefs, because they are sensitive to even minor temperature changes. So a small increase in water temperature could have a significant impact in these environments. Another example is loss of sea ice habitats due to warming. This will have severe impacts on polar bears and other animals that rely on it. The effects of climate change on oceans put additional pressures on ocean ecosystems which are already under pressure by other impacts from human activities.

Changes due to rising greenhouse gas levels
Presently (2020), atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels of more than 410 parts per million (ppm) are nearly 50% higher than preindustrial levels. These elevated levels and rapid growth rates are unprecedented in the geological record's 55 million years. The source for this excess CO2 is clearly established as human-driven, reflecting a mix of fossil fuel burning, industrial, and land-use/land-change emissions. The idea that the ocean serves as a major sink for anthropogenic CO2 has been discussed in scientific literature since at least the late 1950s. Several pieces of evidence point to the ocean absorbing roughly a quarter of total anthropogenic CO2 emissions. 

The latest key findings about the observed changes and impacts from 2019 include:It is virtually certain that the global ocean has warmed unabated since 1970 and has taken up more than 90% of the excess heat in the climate system [...]. Since 1993, the rate of ocean warming has more than doubled [...]. Marine heatwaves have very likely doubled in frequency since 1982 and are increasing in intensity [...]. By absorbing more CO2, the ocean has undergone increasing surface acidification [...]. A loss of oxygen has occurred from the surface to 1000 m [...].

Rising ocean temperature
It is clear that the ocean is warming as a result of climate change, and this rate of warming is increasing.: 9  The global ocean was the warmest it had ever been recorded by humans in 2022. This is determined by the ocean heat content, which exceeded the previous 2021 maximum in 2022. The steady rise in ocean temperatures is an unavoidable result of the Earth's energy imbalance, which is primarily caused by rising levels of greenhouse gases.

ICES Statistical Rectangles,"ICES Statistical Rectangles (aka ""ICES Rectangles"") is a gridded, latitude-longitude based area notation system covering the north-east Atlantic region developed by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) in the 1970s, for simplified analysis and visualization of spatial data of relevance to that organization's interests. The individual rectangles that make up the system each measure 1 degree of longitude by 0.5 degrees of latitude and are intended to be roughly square in real world use in the ICES region of interest, approximately 30 nautical miles by 30 nautical miles (55×55 km) at 60°N, although the actual width varies with latitude, gradually becoming wider than they are high south of 60°N, and narrower further north. The grid covers the region from 36°N to 85°30'N and from 44°W to 69°E (quoted as 68°30') using a set of alphanumeric identifiers, with row of latitude (identifiers 01 through 99, from south to north) cited first, then column of longitude (identifiers A0-A3, then B0-B9, C0-C9 etc., from west to east). The last used column identifier is M8; column identifiers A4-A9, and prefix ""I"" (uppercase ""i"") i.e. columns ""I""0-""I""9 are not used. The resulting grid is 113 columns by 99 rows, comprising 11,187 labelled 1×0.5 degree cells. An example cell designation is 37F3, which designates the 1×0.5 degree rectangle of which the south-west corner is 54°00'N, 03°00'E. The grid covers both land and sea areas across its designated region, but as per the interests of its originating body, is typically employed for use with marine data such as analysis of marine resources, fishing activities, seabed habitat, etc., refer example references below. The full extent of the grid is visible in published figures such as Figs. 5-8 in Williamson et al., 2017.
To accommodate the visualization and/or analysis of finer scale data than is supported by the ""standard"" (1×0.5 degree) rectangles, an optional fifth character (as digits 1 through 9) can be used which will place a location within a finer 9-cell (3 by 3) sub-grid, for which the individual sub-rectangles then measure 20' of longitude by 10' of latitude (approximately 10×10 nautical miles). Sub-rectangle designations go north to south, then west to east, with 1 at the north west corner and 9 at the south east.
ICES rectangles have been used for reporting and analysis in numerous marine publications since the 1970s; for recent examples see. A vector polygon representation of the ICES Statistical Rectangles is available here.

Current (hydrology),"In hydrology, a current in a water body is the flow of water in any one particular direction. The current varies spatially as well as temporally, dependent upon the flow volume of water, stream gradient, and channel geometry. In tidal zones, the current and streams may reverse on the flood tide before resuming on the ebb tide. On a global scale, wind and the rotation of the earth greatly influence the flow of ocean currents.
In a stream or river there the current is influenced by gravity, the term upstream (or upriver) refers to the direction towards the source of the stream (or river), i.e. against the direction of flow. Likewise, the term downstream or downriver describes the direction towards the mouth of the stream or river, in which the current flows. The term ""left bank"" and ""right bank"" refers to banks as seen from the direction of flow, towards the downstream direction.

Non-capitalist way of development,"The Non-Capitalist Way of Development (NCWD) or The Non-Capitalist Path or The Non‐Capitalist Road is a development theory which was proposed by theorists from the socialist bloc, as an alternative political economy to capitalist and imperialist development strategies.

Background
After World War II, a wave of decolonization led to the emergence of many newly independent nations that faced poverty, underdevelopment, and the challenges of Cold War politics. While these countries sought to modernize, they were wary of adopting Western capitalist models, fearing this would reinforce economic dependency and neocolonialism. This skepticism grew as many of these nations adopted non-aligned stances, avoiding alignment with either the United States or the Soviet Union. NCWD was therefore originally promoted by the Soviet Union during the Cold War as an alternative development path for these newly decolonized countries to modernize without fully embracing capitalism or immediately transitioning to socialism. It primarily prioritized state-led modernization from the top over popular uprisings or grassroots socialist revolutions from below (see revolution from above).
From 1954 to 1979 the USSR provided an estimated $18 billion in economic aid and $47 billion in military aid to 76 countries across Africa, Asia, and Latin America.

India (1947 - 1964)
India, under Jawaharlal Nehru, became one of the most prominent examples of this development strategy. Although India remained non-aligned during the Cold War, it accepted substantial Soviet aid, particularly due to its industrialization strategy to substitute imports, which aimed to produce domestically what had previously been imported. A major symbol of Soviet-Indian cooperation was the Bhilai Steel Plant (currently a subsidiary of Steel Authority of India Limited), built in the late 1950s with Soviet funding and expertise. Bhilai became a symbol of India's industrial aspirations and played a central role in Nehru's vision of a mixed economy, balancing private enterprises with state-owned industries in India.

Egypt (1956 - 1970)
After the 1956 Suez Crisis, Egypt, under Gamal Abdel Nasser, shifted towards non-capitalist development, seeking support from the Soviet Union. One key result of this alliance was the construction of the Aswan High Dam, completed in 1970 with Soviet help. The dam symbolized Egypt’s modernization, boosting energy production and agricultural output through hydroelectric power and improved irrigation. It also reinforced Nasser’s Arab socialist policies, combining state control of industries with strong nationalism. However, the dam also caused environmental issues, including the displacement of the Nubian community and changes to the Nile's ecosystem.

Film adaptation,"A film adaptation transfers the details or story of an existing source text, such as a novel, into a feature film. This transfer can involve adapting most details of the source text closely, including characters or plot points, or the original source can serve as loose inspiration, with the implementation of only a few details. Although often considered a type of derivative work, film adaptation has been conceptualized recently by academic scholars such as Robert Stam as a dialogic process.
While the most common form of film adaptation is the use of a novel as the basis, other works adapted into films include non-fiction (including journalism), autobiographical works, comic books, scriptures, plays, historical sources and even other films. Adaptation from such diverse resources has been a ubiquitous practice of filmmaking since the earliest days of cinema in nineteenth-century Europe. In contrast to when making a remake, movie directors usually take more creative liberties when creating a film adaptation, changing the context of factors such as audience or genre.

Fidelity
The Fidelity Argument
One aspect that is usually considered for analyzing adaptations is the fidelity argument. This regards the discussion between scholars, reviewers, or fans, evaluating the effectiveness and success of an adaptation based on how faithfully it follows the original plot and details. This can involve the common discourse of the ""book being better than the movie"" without considering the efforts that go towards a film adaptation.
A film can choose to stay faithful, or stray from the original source text details, but regardless, this medium is created with the use of more elements. Unlike a piece of media like a novel, a film has many aspects to consider, including the script, the music, the actors and their performances, images and shots, and sound effects. All these elements must work together to translate the source material into a feature film. As a type of media that is composed of several elements, a film's runtime often impacts the final product too.
A film adaptation may go against adhering to fidelity for a number of reasons, including the desire for a shift in the time period, cultural context, or perspective of the original plot, and a shift in overall audience. On the other hand, a film adaptation may consider strong fidelity to help promote the work if it is already tied to a popular writer or existing title, especially since it can help financially.
It can be difficult to judge or account for the effectiveness of a film adaptation based solely on fidelity, especially since an adaptation also exists as its own entity outside of the original source text. Although one can consider the original ideas and themes being consistently transposed, an adaptation can also be examined for the new elements it brings audiences.

Types of Fidelity
One way to think of fidelity as other than a measure of success is as different levels of faithfulness to help facilitate discourse. Although not all adaptations aim towards focusing on fidelity for their final product, these labels may help consider how much of a story translates through history.

Close Adaptation
A close adaptation would help define a work that adheres to fidelity closely, implementing most, if not all, details from the original source text. This would include embedding a majority of the original characters, plot points, and timeline. An example of this would include To Kill a Mockingbird (1962) that closely adapted a majority of the details from Harper Lee's 1960 novel of the same name, To Kill a Mockingbird.

Loose Adaptation
A loose adaptation would include any work that mainly uses the original source text as inspiration, straying far from fidelity. This can include instances of only implementing one or two elements, such as the protagonist or title of the original text. This type of adaptation is where the most creative liberties are taken. An example of this would include Clueless (1995), that was loosely adapted from Jane Austen's 1815 novel, Emma, into a modern day context.

Intermediate Adaptation
An intermediate adaptation would consist of a work that falls in between a close and loose adaptation, as it both embeds original source text details, takes creative liberties to incorporate new elements (such as new characters or plot points), and/or excludes certain original details. An example of this would include What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993) that was adapted from Peter Hodge's 1991 novel of the same name, What's Eating Gilbert Grape, that closely adapts a few details, while also excluding certain original characters.

Elision and interpolation
In 1924, Erich von Stroheim attempted a literal adaptation of Frank Norris's novel McTeague with his film Greed. The resulting film was 9½ hours long, and was cut to four hours at studio insistence. It was then cut again (without Stroheim's input) to around two hours.

Naïve physics,"Naïve physics or folk physics is the untrained human perception of basic physical phenomena. In the field of artificial intelligence the study of naïve physics is a part of the effort to formalize the common knowledge of human beings.
Many ideas of folk physics are simplifications, misunderstandings, or misperceptions of well-understood phenomena, incapable of giving useful predictions of detailed experiments, or simply are contradicted by more thorough observations. They may sometimes be true, be true in certain limited cases, be true as a good first approximation to a more complex effect, or predict the same effect but misunderstand the underlying mechanism.
Naïve physics is characterized by a mostly intuitive understanding humans have about objects in the physical world. Certain notions of the physical world may be innate.

Examples
Some examples of naïve physics include commonly understood, intuitive, or everyday-observed rules of nature:

What goes up must come down
A dropped object falls straight down
A solid object cannot pass through another solid object
A vacuum sucks things towards it
An object is either at rest or moving, in an absolute sense
Two events are either simultaneous or they are not
Many of these and similar ideas formed the basis for the first works in formulating and systematizing physics by Aristotle and the medieval scholastics in Western civilization. In the modern science of physics, they were gradually contradicted by the work of Galileo, Newton, and others. The idea of absolute simultaneity survived until 1905, when the special theory of relativity and its supporting experiments discredited it.

Psychological research
The increasing sophistication of technology makes possible more research on knowledge acquisition. Researchers measure physiological responses such as heart rate and eye movement in order to quantify the reaction to a particular stimulus. Concrete physiological data is helpful when observing infant behavior, because infants cannot use words to explain things (such as their reactions) the way most adults or older children can.
Research in naïve physics relies on technology to measure eye gaze and reaction time in particular. Through observation, researchers know that infants get bored looking at the same stimulus after a certain amount of time. That boredom is called habituation. When an infant is sufficiently habituated to a stimulus, he or she will typically look away, alerting the experimenter to his or her boredom. At this point, the experimenter will introduce another stimulus. The infant will then dishabituate by attending to the new stimulus. In each case, the experimenter measures the time it takes for the infant to habituate to each stimulus.
As an example of the use of this method, research by Susan Hespos and colleagues studied five-month-old infants' responses to the physics of liquids and solids. Infants in this research were shown liquid being poured from one glass to another until they were habituated to the event. That is, they spent less time looking at this event. Then, the infants were shown an event in which the liquid turned to a solid, which tumbled from the glass rather flowed. The infants looked longer at the new event; that is, they dishabituated.
Researchers infer that the longer the infant takes to habituate to a new stimulus, the more it violates his or her expectations of physical phenomena. When an adult observes an optical illusion that seems physically impossible, they will attend to it until it makes sense.
It is commonly believed that our understanding of physical laws emerges strictly from experience. But research shows that infants, who do not yet have such expansive knowledge of the world, have the same extended reaction to events that appear physically impossible. Such studies hypothesize that all people are born with an innate ability to understand the physical world.
Smith and Casati (1994) have reviewed the early history of naïve physics, and especially the role of the Italian psychologist Paolo Bozzi.

Types of experiments
The basic experimental procedure of a study on naïve physics involves three steps: prediction of the infant's expectation, violation of that expectation, and measurement of the results. As mentioned above, the physically impossible event holds the infant's attention longer, indicating surprise when expectations are violated.

Solidity
An experiment that tests an infant's knowledge of solidity involves the impossible event of one solid object passing through another. First, the infant is shown a flat, solid square moving from 0° to 180° in an arch formation. Next, a solid block is placed in the path of the screen, preventing it from completing its full range of motion. The infant habituates to this event, as it is what anyone would expect. Then, the experimenter creates the impossible event, and the solid screen passes through the solid block. The infant is confused by the event and attends longer than in p",Physics,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Na%C3%AFve_physics,0,naïve physic folk physic untrained human perception basic physical phenomenon field artificial intelligence study naïve physic part effort formalize common knowledge human being many idea folk physic simplification misunderstanding misperceptions wellunderstood phenomenon incapable giving useful prediction detailed experiment simply contradicted thorough observation may sometimes true true certain limited case true good first approximation complex effect predict effect misunderstand underlying mechanism naïve physic characterized mostly intuitive understanding human object physical world certain notion physical world may innate example example naïve physic include commonly understood intuitive everydayobserved rule nature go must come dropped object fall straight solid object pas another solid object vacuum suck thing towards object either rest moving absolute sense two event either simultaneous many similar idea formed basis first work formulating systematizing physic aristotle medieval scholastic western civilization modern science physic gradually contradicted work galileo newton others idea absolute simultaneity survived special theory relativity supporting experiment discredited psychological research increasing sophistication technology make possible research knowledge acquisition researcher measure physiological response heart rate eye movement order quantify reaction particular stimulus concrete physiological data helpful observing infant behavior infant use word explain thing reaction way adult older child research naïve physic relies technology measure eye gaze reaction time particular observation researcher know infant get bored looking stimulus certain amount time boredom called habituation infant sufficiently habituated stimulus typically look away alerting experimenter boredom point experimenter introduce another stimulus infant dishabituate attending new stimulus case experimenter measure time take infant habituate stimulus example use method research susan hespos colleague studied fivemonthold infant response physic liquid solid infant research shown liquid poured one glass another habituated event spent less time looking event infant shown event liquid turned solid tumbled glass rather flowed infant looked longer new event dishabituated researcher infer longer infant take habituate new stimulus violates expectation physical phenomenon adult observes optical illusion seems physically impossible attend make sense commonly believed understanding physical law emerges strictly experience research show infant yet expansive knowledge world extended reaction event appear physically impossible study hypothesize people born innate ability understand physical world smith casati reviewed early history naïve physic especially role italian psychologist paolo bozzi type experiment basic experimental procedure study naïve physic involves three step prediction infant expectation violation expectation measurement result mentioned physically impossible event hold infant attention longer indicating surprise expectation violated solidity experiment test infant knowledge solidity involves impossible event one solid object passing another first infant shown flat solid square moving ° ° arch formation next solid block placed path screen preventing completing full range motion infant habituates event anyone would expect experimenter creates impossible event solid screen pass solid block infant confused event attends longer p
Ocean,"The ocean is the body of salt water that covers approximately 70.8% of Earth. The ocean is conventionally divided into large bodies of water, which are also referred to as oceans (the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Antarctic/Southern, and Arctic Ocean),  and are themselves mostly divided into seas, gulfs and subsequent bodies of water. The ocean contains 97% of Earth's water and is the primary component of Earth's hydrosphere, acting as a huge reservoir of heat for Earth's energy budget, as well as for its carbon cycle and water cycle, forming the basis for climate and weather patterns worldwide. The ocean is essential to life on Earth, harbouring most of Earth's animals and protist life, originating photosynthesis and therefore Earth's atmospheric oxygen, still supplying half of it.
Ocean scientists split the ocean into vertical and horizontal zones based on physical and biological conditions. Horizontally the ocean covers the oceanic crust, which it shapes. Where the ocean meets dry land it covers relatively shallow continental shelfs, which are part of Earth's continental crust. Human activity is mostly coastal with high negative impacts on marine life. Vertically the pelagic zone is the open ocean's water column from the surface to the ocean floor. The water column is further divided into zones based on depth and the amount of light present. The photic zone starts at the surface and is defined to be ""the depth at which light intensity is only 1% of the surface value"": 36  (approximately 200 m in the open ocean). This is the zone where photosynthesis can occur. In this process plants and microscopic algae (free-floating phytoplankton) use light, water, carbon dioxide, and nutrients to produce organic matter. As a result, the photic zone is the most biodiverse and the source of the food supply which sustains most of the ocean ecosystem. Light can only penetrate a few hundred more meters; the rest of the deeper ocean is cold and dark (these zones are called mesopelagic and aphotic zones).
Ocean temperatures depend on the amount of solar radiation reaching the ocean surface. In the tropics, surface temperatures can rise to over 30 °C (86 °F). Near the poles where sea ice forms, the temperature in equilibrium is about −2 °C (28 °F). In all parts of the ocean, deep ocean temperatures range between −2 °C (28 °F) and 5 °C (41 °F). Constant circulation of water in the ocean creates ocean currents. Those currents are caused by forces operating on the water, such as temperature and salinity differences, atmospheric circulation (wind), and the Coriolis effect. Tides create tidal currents, while wind and waves cause surface currents. The Gulf Stream, Kuroshio Current, Agulhas Current and Antarctic Circumpolar Current are all major ocean currents. Such currents transport massive amounts of water, gases, pollutants and heat to different parts of the world, and from the surface into the deep ocean.  All this has impacts on the global climate system.
Ocean water contains dissolved gases, including oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen. An exchange of these gases occurs at the ocean's surface. The solubility of these gases depends on the temperature and salinity of the water. The carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere is rising due to CO2 emissions, mainly from fossil fuel combustion. As the oceans absorb CO2 from the atmosphere, a higher concentration leads to ocean acidification (a drop in pH value).
The ocean provides many benefits to humans such as ecosystem services, access to seafood and other marine resources, and a means of transport. The ocean is known to be the habitat of over 230,000 species, but may hold considerably more – perhaps over two million species. Yet, the ocean faces many environmental threats, such as marine pollution, overfishing, and the effects of climate change. Those effects include ocean warming, ocean acidification and sea level rise. The continental shelf and coastal waters are most affected by human activity.

Terminology
Ocean and sea
The terms ""the ocean"" or ""the sea"" used without specification refer to the interconnected body of salt water covering the majority of Earth's surface. It includes the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern/Antarctic, and Arctic oceans. As a general term, ""the ocean"" and ""the sea"" are often interchangeable.
Strictly speaking, a ""sea"" is a body of water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land. The word ""sea"" can also be used for many specific, much smaller bodies of seawater, such as the North Sea or the Red Sea. There is no sharp distinction between seas and oceans, though generally seas are smaller, and are often partly (as marginal seas) or wholly (as inland seas) bordered by land.

World Ocean
The contemporary concept of the World Ocean was coined in the early 20th century by the Russian oceanographer Yuly Shokalsky to refer to the continuous ocean that covers and encircles most of Earth.

Supercontinent,"In geology, a supercontinent is the assembly of most or all of Earth's continental blocks or cratons to form a single large landmass. However, some geologists use a different definition, ""a grouping of formerly dispersed continents"", which leaves room for interpretation and is easier to apply to Precambrian times. To separate supercontinents from other groupings, a limit has been proposed in which a continent must include at least about 75% of the continental crust then in existence in order to qualify as a supercontinent.
Moving under the forces of plate tectonics, supercontinents have assembled and dispersed multiple times in the geologic past. According to modern definitions, a supercontinent does not exist today; the closest  is the current Afro-Eurasian landmass, which covers approximately 57% of Earth's total land area. The last period in which the continental landmasses were near to one another was 336 to 175 million years ago, forming the supercontinent Pangaea. The positions of continents have been accurately determined back to the early Jurassic, shortly before the breakup of Pangaea. Pangaea's predecessor Gondwana is not considered a supercontinent under the first definition since the landmasses of Baltica, Laurentia and Siberia were separate at the time.
A future supercontinent, termed Pangaea Proxima, is hypothesized to form within the next 250 million years.

Theories
The Phanerozoic supercontinent Pangaea began to break up 215 Ma and this distancing continues today. Because Pangaea is the most recent of Earth's supercontinents, it is the best known and understood. Contributing to Pangaea's popularity in the classroom, its reconstruction is almost as simple as fitting together the present continents bordering the Atlantic ocean like puzzle pieces.
For the period before Pangaea, there are two contrasting models for supercontinent evolution through geological time.

Series
The first model theorizes that at least two separate supercontinents existed comprising Vaalbara and Kenorland, with Kenorland comprising Superia and Sclavia. These parts of Neoarchean age broke off at ~2480 and 2312 Ma, and portions of them later collided to form Nuna (Northern Europe and North America). Nuna continued to develop during the Mesoproterozoic, primarily by lateral accretion of juvenile arcs, and in ~1000 Ma Nuna collided with other land masses, forming Rodinia. Between ~825 and 750 Ma Rodinia broke apart. However, before completely breaking up, some fragments of Rodinia had already come together to form Gondwana by ~608 Ma. Pangaea formed through the collision of Gondwana, Laurasia (Laurentia and Baltica), and Siberia.

Protopangea–Paleopangea
The second model (Kenorland-Arctica) is based on both palaeomagnetic and geological evidence and proposes that the continental crust comprised a single supercontinent from ~2.72 Ga until break-up during the Ediacaran period after ~0.573 Ga. The reconstruction is derived from the observation that palaeomagnetic poles converge to quasi-static positions for long intervals between ~2.72–2.115 Ga; 1.35–1.13 Ga; and 0.75–0.573 Ga with only small peripheral modifications to the reconstruction. During the intervening periods, the poles conform to a unified apparent polar wander path. 
Although it contrasts the  first model, the first phase (Protopangea) essentially incorporates Vaalbara and Kenorland of the first model. The explanation for the prolonged duration of the Protopangea–Paleopangea supercontinent appears to be that lid tectonics (comparable to the tectonics operating on Mars and Venus) prevailed during Precambrian times. According to this theory, plate tectonics as seen on the contemporary Earth became dominant only during the latter part of geological times. This approach was widely criticized by many researchers as it uses incorrect application of paleomagnetic data.

Cycles
A supercontinent cycle is the break-up of one supercontinent and the development of another, which takes place on a global scale. Supercontinent cycles are not the same as the Wilson cycle, which is the opening and closing of an individual oceanic basin. The Wilson cycle rarely synchronizes with the timing of a supercontinent cycle. However, supercontinent cycles and Wilson cycles were both involved in the creation of Pangaea and Rodinia.
Secular trends such as carbonatites, granulites, eclogites, and greenstone belt deformation events are all possible indicators of Precambrian supercontinent cyclicity, although the Protopangea–Paleopangea solution implies that Phanerozoic style of supercontinent cycles did not operate during these times. Also, there are instances where these secular trends have a weak, uneven, or absent imprint on the supercontinent cycle; secular methods for supercontinent reconstruction will produce results that have only one explanation, and each explanation for a trend must fit in with the rest.

Boston school (painting),"The Boston school was a group of Boston-based painters active in the first three decades of the twentieth century. Often classified as American Impressionists, they had their own regional style, combining the painterliness of Impressionism with a more conservative approach to figure painting and a marked respect for the traditions of Western art history. Their preferred subject matter was genteel: portraits, picturesque landscapes, and young women posing in well-appointed interiors. Major influences included John Singer Sargent, Claude Monet, and Jan Vermeer. Key figures in the Boston school were Edmund C. Tarbell, Frank Weston Benson, and William McGregor Paxton, all of whom trained in Paris at the Académie Julian and later taught at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts. Their influence can still be seen in the work of some contemporary Boston-area artists.

History
The progenitors of the Boston school were Edmund C. Tarbell, Frank Weston Benson, and William McGregor Paxton, all of whom trained in Paris at the Académie Julian and later taught at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts. Their interest in modern French art can be traced to William Morris Hunt, a well-known teacher, painter, and taste-maker in late nineteenth-century Boston. After a visit to Paris, Hunt, who was on the original advisory board of the Museum of Fine Arts, encouraged prominent Bostonians to invest in the work of French artists such as Millet, Monet, and Renoir. Through his influence, the MFA hosted the first American exhibition of Monet's work in 1911.
Tarbell, Benson, and Paxton trained at the museum school in its early days. Tarbell eventually became so influential that the painters in his immediate circle were referred to by critics of the time as ""Tarbellites"". The Tarbellites specialized at first in Impressionistic and Barbizon-influenced landscapes. Later they gravitated to indoor scenes, typically featuring women engaged in household duties, recalling the domestic subjects of Dutch painters such as Vermeer. They also painted visually appealing still lifes and portraits after the manner of John Singer Sargent.
From these various influences, the Boston painters synthesized their own regional style. As painter William Merritt Chase remarked at the time, ""A new type has appeared, the offspring, as we know, of European stock, but which no longer resembles it."" They placed a high value on technical skill, accurate visual representation, and classical beauty, while adopting what was then a very modern, ""loose"" style of painting from the French.
Other painters associated with the Boston school include Joseph DeCamp, Philip Leslie Hale, Lilian Westcott Hale, John Joseph Enneking, Gretchen Woodman Rogers, Aldro Hibbard, Frederic Porter Vinton, Lilla Cabot Perry, Elizabeth Okie Paxton, Hermann Dudley Murphy, W. Lester Stevens, and others. Tarbell's teacher at the museum school, Emil Otto Grundmann, is sometimes included in this group.
In addition to paintings, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts includes sculptures and drawings in its Boston school gallery, such as ""Blind Cupid"" by Bela Pratt and pastel drawings by Laura Coombs Hills.

Ongoing tradition
Later artists working in this style include R. H. Gammell, Yoshi Mizutani, Charles Tersolo, Thomas R Dunlay, Melody Phaneuf, Sam Vokey, Candace Whittemore Lovely, and Dianne Panarelli Miller. Dana Levin, founder of the New School of Classical Art, an atelier in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, cites the Boston school as a key influence. Charles H. Cecil, founder of Charles H. Cecil Studios in Florence, Italy, was trained by R. H. Ives Gammell and continues to pass on the methods of the Boston painters to his students. Several artists working in the tradition of the Boston school exhibit at the Copley Society of Art and the Guild Of Boston Artists on Newbury Street.

Reception
Although they are now seen as traditionalists, painters of the Boston school were criticized by academics in the early days for their daring use of Impressionistic techniques. They soon achieved national renown, and continued to dominate the art scene in aesthetically conservative Boston through the 1930s and into the forties. They were admired for their dedication to craftsmanship and beauty at a time when modernists were challenging traditional artistic values.
In recent times they have come under criticism for focusing on the lives of the upper class. Though not necessarily well off themselves, many of the artists worked on commission for wealthy Boston Brahmin patrons. In At Beck and Call: The Representation of Domestic Servants in Nineteenth-Century American Painting, Elizabeth O'Leary notes that servants in paintings of the time were often framed in windows and doorways, creating a distancing effect, as seen in Tarbell's ""The Breakfast Room"" (above). Where they were prominently featured in paintings, she argues that they were treated as status symbols, akin to valuable possessions.

Sea,"A sea is a large body of salt water. There are particular seas and the sea. The sea commonly refers to the ocean, the interconnected body of seawaters that spans most of Earth. Particular seas are either marginal seas, second-order sections of the oceanic sea (e.g. the Mediterranean Sea), or certain large, nearly landlocked bodies of water.
The salinity of water bodies varies widely, being lower near the surface and the mouths of large rivers and higher in the depths of the ocean; however, the relative proportions of dissolved salts vary little across the oceans. The most abundant solid dissolved in seawater is sodium chloride. The water also contains salts of magnesium, calcium, potassium, and mercury, among other elements, some in minute concentrations. A wide variety of organisms, including bacteria, protists, algae, plants, fungi, and animals live in various marine habitats and ecosystems throughout the seas. These range vertically from the sunlit surface and shoreline to the great depths and pressures of the cold, dark abyssal zone, and in latitude from the cold waters under polar ice caps to the warm waters of coral reefs in tropical regions. Many of the major groups of organisms evolved in the sea and life may have started there.
The ocean moderates Earth's climate and has important roles in the water, carbon, and nitrogen cycles. The surface of water interacts with the atmosphere, exchanging properties such as particles and temperature, as well as currents. Surface currents are the water currents that are produced by the atmosphere's currents and its winds blowing over the surface of the water, producing wind waves, setting up through drag slow but stable circulations of water, as in the case of the ocean sustaining deep-sea ocean currents. Deep-sea currents, known together as the global conveyor belt, carry cold water from near the poles to every ocean and significantly influence Earth's climate. Tides, the generally twice-daily rise and fall of sea levels, are caused by Earth's rotation and the gravitational effects of the Moon and, to a lesser extent, of the Sun. Tides may have a very high range in bays or estuaries. Submarine earthquakes arising from tectonic plate movements under the oceans can lead to destructive tsunamis, as can volcanoes, huge landslides, or the impact of large meteorites.
The seas have been an integral element for humans throughout history and culture. Humans harnessing and studying the seas have been recorded since ancient times and evidenced well into prehistory, while its modern scientific study is called oceanography and maritime space is governed by the law of the sea, with admiralty law regulating human interactions at sea. The seas provide substantial supplies of food for humans, mainly fish, but also shellfish, mammals and seaweed, whether caught by fishermen or farmed underwater. Other human uses of the seas include trade, travel, mineral extraction, power generation, warfare, and leisure activities such as swimming, sailing, and scuba diving. Many of these activities create marine pollution.

Definition
The sea is the interconnected system of all the Earth's oceanic waters, including the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, Southern and Arctic Oceans. However, the word ""sea"" can also be used for many specific, much smaller bodies of seawater, such as the North Sea or the Red Sea. There is no sharp distinction between seas and oceans, though generally seas are smaller, and are often partly (as marginal seas or particularly as a mediterranean sea) or wholly (as inland seas) enclosed by land. However, an exception to this is the Sargasso Sea which has no coastline and lies within a circular current, the North Atlantic Gyre.: 90  Seas are generally larger than lakes and contain salt water, but the Sea of Galilee is a freshwater lake. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea states that all of the ocean is ""sea"".

Legal definition
The law of the sea has at its centre the definition of the boundaries of the ocean, clarifying its application in marginal seas. But what bodies of water other than the sea the law applies to is being crucially negotiated in the case of the Caspian Sea and its status as ""sea"", basically revolving around the issue of the Caspian Sea about either being factually an oceanic sea or only a saline body of water and therefore solely a sea in the sense of the common use of the word, like all other saltwater lakes called sea.

Physical science
Earth is the only known planet with seas of liquid water on its surface,: 22  although Mars possesses ice caps and similar planets in other solar systems may have oceans. Earth's 1,335,000,000 cubic kilometers (320,000,000 cu mi) of sea contain about 97.2 percent of its known water and covers approximately 71 percent of its surface.: 7  Another 2.15% of Earth's water is frozen, found in the sea ice covering the Arctic Ocean, the ice cap covering Antarctica and its adjacent seas, and various glaciers and surface",Oceans,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea,1,sea large body salt water particular sea sea sea commonly refers ocean interconnected body seawater span earth particular sea either marginal sea secondorder section oceanic sea eg mediterranean sea certain large nearly landlocked body water salinity water body varies widely lower near surface mouth large river higher depth ocean however relative proportion dissolved salt vary little across ocean abundant solid dissolved seawater sodium chloride water also contains salt magnesium calcium potassium mercury among element minute concentration wide variety organism including bacteria protist algae plant fungi animal live various marine habitat ecosystem throughout sea range vertically sunlit surface shoreline great depth pressure cold dark abyssal zone latitude cold water polar ice cap warm water coral reef tropical region many major group organism evolved sea life may started ocean moderate earth climate important role water carbon nitrogen cycle surface water interacts atmosphere exchanging property particle temperature well current surface current water current produced atmosphere current wind blowing surface water producing wind wave setting drag slow stable circulation water case ocean sustaining deepsea ocean current deepsea current known together global conveyor belt carry cold water near pole every ocean significantly influence earth climate tide generally twicedaily rise fall sea level caused earth rotation gravitational effect moon lesser extent sun tide may high range bay estuary submarine earthquake arising tectonic plate movement ocean lead destructive tsunami volcano huge landslide impact large meteorite sea integral element human throughout history culture human harnessing studying sea recorded since ancient time evidenced well prehistory modern scientific study called oceanography maritime space governed law sea admiralty law regulating human interaction sea sea provide substantial supply food human mainly fish also shellfish mammal seaweed whether caught fisherman farmed underwater human us sea include trade travel mineral extraction power generation warfare leisure activity swimming sailing scuba diving many activity create marine pollution definition sea interconnected system earth oceanic water including atlantic pacific indian southern arctic ocean however word sea also used many specific much smaller body seawater north sea red sea sharp distinction sea ocean though generally sea smaller often partly marginal sea particularly mediterranean sea wholly inland sea enclosed land however exception sargasso sea coastline lie within circular current north atlantic gyre sea generally larger lake contain salt water sea galilee freshwater lake united nation convention law sea state ocean sea legal definition law sea centre definition boundary ocean clarifying application marginal sea body water sea law applies crucially negotiated case caspian sea status sea basically revolving around issue caspian sea either factually oceanic sea saline body water therefore solely sea sense common use word like saltwater lake called sea physical science earth known planet sea liquid water surface although mar possesses ice cap similar planet solar system may ocean earth cubic kilometer cu mi sea contain percent known water cover approximately percent surface another earth water frozen found sea ice covering arctic ocean ice cap covering antarctica adjacent sea various glacier surface
StoryBots,"StoryBots is an American children's media franchise that produces educational TV series, books, videos, music, video games, and classroom activities. Its productions include the Netflix series Ask the StoryBots, StoryBots: Answer Time, StoryBots: Super Silly Stories with Bo, and StoryBots Super Songs.
After launching online and gaining more than 620 million views on YouTube,  StoryBots launched its first television series on the streaming service Netflix in 2016. Over three seasons, Ask the StoryBots has won multiple Daytime Emmy Awards and an Annie Award, along with recognition from the Peabody Awards and British Academy Children's Awards. It also spawned a companion show, StoryBots Super Songs, and a holiday special, A StoryBots Christmas.
Created by the entertainment studio JibJab, the brand later became part of StoryBots, Inc., an independent production company. StoryBots, Inc., (along with the StoryBots brand) was acquired by Netflix in May 2019 as part of an overall push by the streaming service into more educational and family-oriented content.

History
StoryBots launched to the public in the summer of 2012 and has been featured on CNN, The New York Times, CNBC, and other news outlets. Gregg Spiridellis, co-founder and CEO of StoryBots, told CNBC in 2013 that he and his brother had five young children between them and noticed ""a massive shift in how kids are consuming media"". Spiridellis stated that this shift became the inspiration for StoryBots, with digital content akin to Sesame Street created for a device-centric, connected generation of children.
In May 2019, Netflix announced that it had acquired the StoryBots media franchise and signed co-creators Evan and Gregg Spiridellis to an exclusive producing deal. The acquisition was the first of its kind for Netflix and was part of a stated commitment to expand its educational content.

Television programming
The StoryBots franchise's original TV series Ask the StoryBots premiered on Netflix on August 12, 2016. The show follows the StoryBots characters Beep, Bing, Bang, Boop, and Bo (a.k.a. ""Answer Team 341B""), and stars Judy Greer. Answer Team 341B goes on adventures into the human world to help answer kids' biggest questions. The first season featured guest appearances from Jay Leno, Whoopi Goldberg, "" Weird Al"" Yankovic, Kevin Smith, Garfunkel and Oates, Tim Meadows, and Chris Parnell. Ask the StoryBots received critical acclaim for its educational quality and entertainment value for both parents and children. A second season premiered on Netflix on August 24, 2018, and featured guest appearances from Snoop Dogg, Edward Norton, Christina Applegate, Wanda Sykes, David Cross, Ali Wong, Kristen Schaal, and David Koechner.
A third season was released worldwide on Netflix on August 2, 2019, and includes guest appearances from John Legend, Zoe Saldana, Jennifer Garner, Jason Sudeikis, Alyssa Milano, Tony Hale, Maria Bamford, and Reggie Watts. A trailer for the new episodes was released on YouTube ahead of the season launch. All three season's music soundtracks are available on most music streaming services.

Spinoffs
A companion series, StoryBots Super Songs, premiered on October 7, 2016, also on Netflix. While each episode of Ask the StoryBots featured the lead characters answering a child's single question, StoryBots Super Songs focused on broader topics, such as outer space, colors, shapes, and dinosaurs, through music and live-action vignettes with real children. Episodes were also released on StoryBots' YouTube channel.
Ask the StoryBots also spun off a holiday special, A StoryBots Christmas, which premiered December 1, 2017, on Netflix. Featuring a guest appearance by Ed Asner as Santa Claus, the special received two Daytime Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Special Class Animated Program, as well as four additional nominations.
A new series called StoryBots: Answer Time premiered on Netflix on November 21, 2022, and includes guest appearances from Danny DeVito, Zooey Deschanel, Common, Sophie Turner, Kevin Smith, Anne Hathaway, Chrissy Teigen, Patton Oswalt, Gabriel Iglesias, and Craig Robinson. A second season of this show premiered on Netflix on July 10, 2023, and includes guest appearances from Rainn Wilson, Josh Gad, Wendi McLendon-Covey, Scarlett Johansson, Gabrielle Union, Joe Lo Truglio, Steve Buscemi, Kristen Bell, Simu Liu, Julie Bowen, Trevor Noah, and Jessica Alba.
Another spin-off series called StoryBots: Super Silly Stories with Bo  premiered on Netflix's YouTube channel on June 26, 2022. The series consisted of four seasons, with a total of 26 short form episodes (approximately four to six minutes in length), and four long-form episodes (approximately 22 to 44 minutes in length). Directed, co-written, and edited by Henry Dalton, this series differed from Ask The StoryBots and StoryBots: Answer Time in being comedy-led rather than centering around a child's question to be answered.

Tropical desert,"Tropical deserts  are located in regions between 15 and 30 degrees latitude. The environment is very extreme, and they have the highest average monthly temperature on Earth. Rainfall is sporadic; precipitation may not be observed at all in a few years. In addition to these extreme environmental and climate conditions, most tropical deserts are covered with sand and rocks, and thus too flat and lacking in vegetation to block out the wind. Wind may erode and transport sand, rocks and other materials; these are known as eolian processes. Landforms caused by wind erosion vary greatly in characteristics and size. Representative landforms include depressions and pans, Yardangs, inverted topography and ventifacts. No significant populations can survive in tropical deserts due to extreme aridity, heat and the paucity of vegetation; only specific flora and fauna with special behavioral and physical mechanisms are supported. Although tropical deserts are considered to be harsh and barren, they are in fact important sources of natural resources and play a significant role in economic development. Besides the equatorial deserts, there are many hot deserts situated in the tropical zone.

Distribution
Geographical distribution
Tropical deserts are located in both continental interiors and coastal areas between the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn. Representative deserts include the Sahara Desert in North Africa, the Australian Desert in Western and Southern Australia, Arabian Desert and Syrian Desert in Western Asia, the Kalahari Desert in Southern Africa, Sonoran Desert in the United States and Mexico, Mojave Desert in the United States, Thar Desert in India and Pakistan, Dasht-e Margo and Registan Desert in Afghanistan and Dasht-e Kavir and Dasht-e Loot in Iran.

Controlling factor
Tropics form a belt around the equator from latitude 3 degrees north to latitude 3 degrees south, which is called the Intertropical Convergence Zone. Tropical heat generates unstable air in this area, and air masses become extremely dry due to the loss of moisture during the process of tropical ascent.

Another significant determinant of tropical desert climate are Hadley cells. Hadley cells concentrate all precipitations in the hotter humid lower pressure equator, leaving colder higher pressure deserts with no precipitation.

Characteristics
Temperature
Tropical deserts have the highest average daily temperature on the planet, as both the energy input during the day and the loss of heat at night are large. This phenomenon causes an extremely large daily temperature range. Specifically, temperatures in a low elevation inland desert can reach 40°C to 50°C during the day, and drop to approximately 5°C at night; the daily range is around 30 to 40°C.
There are some other reasons for significant changes in temperature in tropical deserts. For instance, a lack of water and vegetation on the ground can enhance the absorption of the heat due to insolation. Subsiding air from dominant high pressure areas in a cloud-free sky can also lead to large amounts of insolation; a cloudless sky enables day temperature to escape rapidly at night.
Precipitation is very irregular in tropical deserts. The average annual precipitation in low latitude deserts is less than 250 mm. Relative humidity is very low – only 10% to 30% in interior locations, and even the dewpoints are typically very low, often being well below the freezing mark. Some deserts do not have rainfall all year round, they are located far from the ocean. High-pressure cells and high temperatures can also increase the level of aridity.

Wind
Wind greatly contributes to aridity in tropical deserts. If wind speed exceeds 80 km/h, it can generate dust storms and sandstorms and erode the rocky surface. Therefore, wind plays an important role in shaping various landforms. This phenomenon is known as the eolian process. There are two types of eolian process: deflation and abrasion.  
First, deflation may cause the light lowering of ground surface, leading to deflation hollows, plains, basins, blowouts, wind-eroded plains and parabolic dunes. Second, the eolian process leads to abrasion, which forms special landforms with a significant undercut.

Landforms
Various landforms are found in tropical deserts due to different kinds of eolian process. The major landforms are dunes, depressions and pans, yardangs, and inverted topography.

Dunes
There are various kinds of dune in tropical deserts. Representative dunes include dome dunes, transverse dunes, barchans, star dunes, shadow dunes, linear dunes and longitudinal dunes.

Depression
A desert depression is caused by polygenetic factors such as wind erosion, broad shallow warping and block faulting, stream erosion, karst activity, salt weathering mass wasting, and zoogenic processes; representative examples are the large enclosed basins in Africa, such as Farafra, Baharia, Dakhla, Qattara, Siwa and Kargha.

Fell,"A fell (from Old Norse fell, fjall, ""mountain"") is a high and barren landscape feature, such as a mountain or moor-covered hill. The term is most often employed in Fennoscandia, Iceland, the Isle of Man, parts of northern England, and Scotland.

Etymology
The English word ""fell"" comes from Old Norse fell and fjall (both forms existed). It is cognate with Danish fjeld, Faroese fjall and fjøll, Icelandic fjall and fell, Norwegian fjell with dialects fjøll, fjødd, fjedd, fjedl, fjill, fil(l), and fel, and Swedish fjäll, all referring to mountains rising above the alpine tree line.

British Isles
In northern England, especially in the Lake District and in the Pennine Dales, the word ""fell"" originally referred to an area of uncultivated high ground used as common grazing usually on common land and above the timberline. Today, generally, ""fell"" refers to the mountains and hills of the Lake District and the Pennine Dales.
Names that originally referred to grazing areas have been applied to these hilltops. This is the case with Seathwaite Fell, for example, which would be the common grazing land used by the farmers of Seathwaite. The fellgate marks the road from a settlement onto the fell (see photograph for example), as is the case with the Seathwaite Fell. In other cases the reverse is true; for instance, the name of Wetherlam, in the Coniston Fells, though understood to refer to the mountain as a whole, strictly speaking refers to the summit; the slopes have names such as Tilberthwaite High Fell, Low Fell and Above Beck Fells.

The word ""fell"" is also used in the names of various breeds of livestock, bred for life on the uplands, such as Rough Fell sheep, Fell terriers and Fell ponies.
It is also found in many place names across the north of England, often attached to the name of a community; thus the township of Cartmel Fell.
In northern England, there is a Lord of the Fells – this ancient aristocratic title being associated with the Lords of Bowland.
Groups of cairns are a common feature on many fells, often marking the summit – there are fine examples on Wild Boar Fell in Mallerstang Dale, Cumbria, and on Nine Standards Rigg just outside Kirkby Stephen, Cumbria.
As the most mountainous region of England, the Lake District is the area most closely associated with the sport of fell running, which takes its name from the fells of the district. ""Fellwalking"" is also the term used locally for the activity known in the rest of Great Britain as hillwalking.
The word ""fell"" also enjoys limited use in Scotland; with, for example, the Campsie Fells in central Scotland, to the north-east of Glasgow. One of the most famous examples of the use of the word ""fell"" in Scotland is Goat Fell, the highest point on the Isle of Arran. Criffel and the nearby Long Fell in Galloway may be seen from the northern Lake District of England. Peel Fell in the Kielder Forest is  on the border between the Scottish Borders to the north and the English county of Northumberland to the south.

Fennoscandia
Norway
In Norway, fjell, in common usage, is generally interpreted as simply a summit or area of greater altitude than a hill, which leads to a great deal of local variation in what is defined as a fjell. Fjell is mostly used about areas above the forest line. Distinct summits can be referred to as et fjell (a mountain). High plateaus (vidde landscape) such as Hardangervidda are also regarded as fjell. Professor of geography at the University of Bergen, Anders Lundeberg, has summed up the problem by stating,  ""There simply is no fixed and unambiguous definition of fjell."" Ivar Aasen defined fjell as a ""tall berg"", primarily referring to a berg that reaches an altitude where trees do not grow, lower berg are referred to as ""berg"", ås (hill, ridge) or hei (moor, heathland). The fixed expression til fjells refers to mountains (or uplands) as a collective rather than a specific location or specific summit (the ""s"" in til fjells is an old genitive form remaining only in fixed expressions). According to Ivar Aasen, berg refers to cliffs, bedrock and notable elevations of the surface underpinned by bedrock; berg also refers to the substance of bedrock. For all practical purposes, fjell can be translated as ""mountain"" and the Norwegian language has no other commonly used word for mountain.

Sweden
In Sweden, fjäll generally refers to any mountain or upland high enough that forest will not naturally survive at the top, in effect a mountain tundra. Fjäll is primarily used to describe mountains in the Nordic countries, but also more generally to describe mountains shaped by massive ice sheets, primarily in Arctic and subarctic regions. There are however dialectal differences in usage, with comparatively low mountains or plateaus, sometimes tree-covered, in Bohuslän and Västergötland (e.g. Safjällets naturreservat and Kynnefjäll) being referred to as ""fjäll"", similar to how the word is used in Norwegian

Deep sea mining,"Deep sea mining is the extraction of minerals from the seabed of the deep sea. The main ores of commercial interest are polymetallic nodules, which are found at depths of 4–6 km (2.5–3.7 mi) primarily on the abyssal plain. The Clarion–Clipperton zone (CCZ) alone contains over 21 billion metric tons of these nodules, with minerals such as copper, nickel, cobalt and manganese making up roughly 30% of their weight. It is estimated that the global ocean floor holds more than 120 million tons of cobalt, five times the amount found in terrestrial reserves.
As of July 2024, only exploratory licenses have been issued, with no commercial-scale deep sea mining operations yet. The International Seabed Authority (ISA) regulates all mineral-related activities in international waters and has granted 31 exploration licenses so far: 19 for polymetallic nodules, mostly in the CCZ; 7 for polymetallic sulphides in mid-ocean ridges; and 5 for cobalt-rich crusts in the Western Pacific Ocean. There is a push for deep sea mining to commence by 2025, when regulations by the ISA are expected to be completed.
In April 2025, U.S. President Trump signed an Executive Order instructing the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to expedite permits for companies to mine in both international and U.S. territorial waters, citing the Deep Seabed Hard Minerals Resource Act of 1980.
Deep sea mining is being considered in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of countries, such as Norway, where in January 2024 the government announced its intention to allow companies to apply for exploration permits in 2025. In December 2024, Norway’s plans to begin awarding exploration licenses were temporarily put on hold after the Socialist Left Party (SV) blocked the planned licensing round as part of negotiations over the government budget. In 2022, the Cook Islands Seabed Minerals Authority (SBMA) granted three exploration licenses for cobalt-rich polymetallic nodules within their EEZ. In 2025, it was announced that the Cook Islands had signed a deal with China focussed on deep-sea mining. Papua New Guinea was the first country to approve a deep sea mining permit in state waters for the Solwara 1 project, despite three independent reviews highlighting significant gaps and flaws in the environmental impact statement.
The most common commercial model of deep sea mining proposed involves a caterpillar-track hydraulic collector and a riser lift system bringing the harvested ore to a production support vessel with dynamic positioning, and then depositing extra discharge down the water column below 2,000 meters. Related technologies include robotic mining machines, as surface ships, and offshore and onshore metal refineries. Though largely composed of nickel and manganese which are most widely used as key inputs into the steel industry, wind  farms, solar energy, electric vehicles, and battery technologies use many of the deep-sea metals. Electric vehicle batteries are a key driver of the critical metals demand that incentivizes deep sea mining, as well as demands for the production of aerospace and defense technologies, and infrastructure.
The environmental impact of deep sea mining is controversial. Environmental advocacy groups such as Greenpeace and the Deep Sea Mining Campaign claimed that seabed mining has the potential to damage deep sea ecosystems and spread pollution from heavy metal-laden plumes. Critics have called for moratoria or permanent bans. Opposition campaigns enlisted the support of some industry figures, including firms reliant on the target metals. Individual countries like Norway, Cook Islands, India, Brazil and others with significant deposits within their exclusive economic zones (EEZ's) are exploring the subject.
As of 2021, the majority of marine mining used dredging operations in far shallower depths of less than 200 m, where sand, silt and mud for construction purposes is abundant, along with mineral rich sands containing ilmenite and diamonds.

Deposit types
Deep sea ore deposits are classified into three main types: polymetallic nodules, polymetallic sulfide deposits, and cobalt-rich crusts.: 356

Polymetallic nodules
Polymetallic nodules are found at depths of 4–6 km (2.5–3.7 mi) in all major oceans, though due to their metallic composition those in the Pacific Ocean are of greatest commercial interest. Nodules may also be found in shallow waters like the Baltic Sea and in freshwater lakes. They are the most readily minable type of deep sea ore. These nodules typically range in size from 4–14 cm (1.6–5.5 in) in diameter, though some can be as large as 15 cm (5.9 in).
Manganese and related hydroxides precipitate from ocean water or sediment-pore water around a nucleus, which may be a shark's tooth or a quartz grain, forming potato-shaped nodules some 4–14 cm (1.6–5.5 in) in diameter. They accrete at rates of 1–15 mm per million years.

City,"A city is a human settlement of a substantial size. The term ""city"" has different meanings around the world and in some places the settlement can be very small. Even where the term is limited to larger settlements, there is no universally agreed definition of the lower boundary for their size. In a narrower sense, a city can be defined as a permanent and densely populated place with administratively defined boundaries whose members work primarily on non-agricultural tasks. Cities generally have extensive systems for housing, transportation, sanitation, utilities, land use, production of goods, and communication. Their density facilitates interaction between people, government organizations, and businesses, sometimes benefiting different parties in the process, such as improving the efficiency of goods and service distribution.
Historically, city dwellers have been a small proportion of humanity overall, but following two centuries of unprecedented and rapid urbanization, more than half of the world population now lives in cities, which has had profound consequences for global sustainability. Present-day cities usually form the core of larger metropolitan areas and urban areas—creating numerous commuters traveling toward city centres for employment, entertainment, and education. However, in a world of intensifying globalization, all cities are to varying degrees also connected globally beyond these regions. This increased influence means that cities also have significant influences on global issues, such as sustainable development, climate change, and global health. Because of these major influences on global issues, the international community has prioritized investment in sustainable cities through Sustainable Development Goal 11. Due to the efficiency of transportation and the smaller land consumption, dense cities hold the potential to have a smaller ecological footprint per inhabitant than more sparsely populated areas. Therefore, compact cities are often referred to as a crucial element in fighting climate change. However, this concentration can also have some significant harmful effects, such as forming urban heat islands, concentrating pollution, and stressing water supplies and other resources.

Meaning
A city can be distinguished from other human settlements by its relatively great size, but also by its functions and its special symbolic status, which may be conferred by a central authority. The term can also refer either to the physical streets and buildings of the city or to the collection of people who dwell there and can be used in a general sense to mean urban rather than rural territory.
National censuses use a variety of definitions – invoking factors such as population, population density, number of dwellings, economic function, and infrastructure – to classify populations as urban. Typical working definitions for small-city populations start at around 100,000 people. Common population definitions for an urban area (city or town) range between 1,500 and 50,000 people, with most U.S. states using a minimum between 1,500 and 5,000 inhabitants. Some jurisdictions set no such criteria. In Australia, the definition of what constitutes a city varies between the states.
In the United Kingdom, city status is awarded by the Crown and then remains permanent, with only two exceptions to this rule due to policy changes. A lack of official qualifying criteria results in some particularly small cities, notably St Davids with a population of 1,751 as of 2021.
According to the ""functional definition"", a city is not distinguished by size alone, but also by the role it plays within a larger political context. Cities serve as administrative, commercial, religious, and cultural hubs for their larger surrounding areas. The presence of a literate elite is often associated with cities because of the cultural diversities present in a city. A typical city has professional administrators, regulations, and some form of taxation (food and other necessities or means to trade for them) to support the government workers. (This arrangement contrasts with the more typically horizontal relationships in a tribe or village accomplishing common goals through informal agreements between neighbors, or the leadership of a chief.) The governments may be based on heredity, religion, military power, work systems such as canal-building, food distribution, land-ownership, agriculture, commerce, manufacturing, finance, or a combination of these. Societies that live in cities are often called civilizations.
The degree of urbanization is a modern metric to help define what comprises a city: ""a population of at least 50,000 inhabitants in contiguous dense grid cells (>1,500 inhabitants per square kilometer)"". This metric was ""devised over years by the European Commission, OECD, World Bank and others, and endorsed in March [2021] by the United Nations ... largely for the purpose of international statistical comparison"".

Economic impact analysis,"An economic impact analysis (EIA) examines the effect of an event on the economy in a specified area, ranging from a single neighborhood to the entire globe. It usually measures changes in business revenue, business profits, personal wages, and/or jobs.  The economic event analyzed can include implementation of a new policy or project, or may simply be the presence of a business or organization.  An economic impact analysis is commonly conducted when there is public concern about the potential impacts of a proposed project or policy.
An economic impact analysis typically measures or estimates the change in economic activity between two scenarios, one assuming the economic event occurs, and one assuming it does not occur (which is referred to as the counterfactual case).  This can be accomplished either before or after the event (ex ante or ex post).
An economic impact analysis attempts to measure or estimate the change in economic activity in a specified region, caused by a specific business, organization, policy, program, project, activity, or other economic event.  The study region can be a neighborhood, town, city, county, statistical area, state, country, continent, or the entire globe.
outside of the study region, so the output impact is not synonymous with local business profits.  A more conservative measure of economic activity is the value added impact, which estimates the increase in the study region's gross regional product.  The gross regional product (GRP) is very similar to the nation's gross domestic product (GDP), and represents the total size of the local economy.  This impact estimates the increase in local employee wages plus local business profits (not total revenue, like the output impact).  However, the value added impact may overstate local profits when they are transferred overseas (such as in the form of dividends or investments in foreign facilities).
An even more conservative measure is the woman labour income impact, which represents the increase in total money paid to local employees in the form of salaries and wages.  The increases in income may come in the form of raises and/or increased hours for existing employees, or new jobs for the unemployed.  This is a measure of the economic impact on just personal incomes, not business revenues or profits.  A similar measure is the employment impact, which measures the increase in the number of total employees in the local region.  Instead of measuring the economic impact in terms of money, this measure presents the impact on the number of jobs in the region.

Sources of economic impacts
In addition to the types of impacts, economic impact analyses often estimate the sources of the impacts.  Each impact can be decomposed into different components, depending on the effect that caused the impact.  Direct effects are the results of the money initially spent in the study region by the business or organization being studied.  This includes money spent to pay for salaries, supplies, raw materials, and operating expenses.
The direct effects from the initial spending creates additional activity in the local economy.  Indirect effects are the results of business-to-business transactions indirectly caused by the direct effects.  Businesses initially benefiting from the direct effects will subsequently increase spending at other local businesses.  The indirect effect is a measure of this increase in business-to-business activity (not including the initial round of spending, which is included in the direct effects).
Induced effects are the results of increased personal income caused by the direct and indirect effects.  Businesses experiencing increased revenue from the direct and indirect effects will subsequently increase payroll expenditures (by hiring more employees, increasing payroll hours, raising salaries, etc.).  Households will, in turn, increase spending at local businesses.  The induced effect is a measure of this increase in household-to-business activity.  Finally, dynamic effects are caused by geographic shifts over time in populations and businesses.

Method
Economic impact analyses usually employ one of two methods for determining impacts.  The first is an input-output model (I/O model) for analyzing the regional economy.  These models rely on inter-industry data to determine how effects in one industry will impact other sectors.  In addition, I/O models also estimate the share of each industry's purchases that are supplied by local firms (versus those outside the study area).  Based on this data, multipliers are calculated and used to estimate economic impacts.  Examples of I/O models used for economic impact analyses are IMPLAN, RIMS-II, Chmura, Emsi, and aLocal Solutions.
Another method used for economic impact analyses are economic simulation models.  These are more complex econometric and general equilibrium models.  They account for everything the I/O model does, plus they forecast the impacts caused by future economic and de",Economics,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_impact_analysis,0,economic impact analysis eia examines effect event economy specified area ranging single neighborhood entire globe usually measure change business revenue business profit personal wage andor job economic event analyzed include implementation new policy project may simply presence business organization economic impact analysis commonly conducted public concern potential impact proposed project policy economic impact analysis typically measure estimate change economic activity two scenario one assuming economic event occurs one assuming occur referred counterfactual case accomplished either event ex ante ex post economic impact analysis attempt measure estimate change economic activity specified region caused specific business organization policy program project activity economic event study region neighborhood town city county statistical area state country continent entire globe outside study region output impact synonymous local business profit conservative measure economic activity value added impact estimate increase study region gross regional product gross regional product grp similar nation gross domestic product gdp represents total size local economy impact estimate increase local employee wage plus local business profit total revenue like output impact however value added impact may overstate local profit transferred overseas form dividend investment foreign facility even conservative measure woman labour income impact represents increase total money paid local employee form salary wage increase income may come form raise andor increased hour existing employee new job unemployed measure economic impact personal income business revenue profit similar measure employment impact measure increase number total employee local region instead measuring economic impact term money measure present impact number job region source economic impact addition type impact economic impact analysis often estimate source impact impact decomposed different component depending effect caused impact direct effect result money initially spent study region business organization studied includes money spent pay salary supply raw material operating expense direct effect initial spending creates additional activity local economy indirect effect result businesstobusiness transaction indirectly caused direct effect business initially benefiting direct effect subsequently increase spending local business indirect effect measure increase businesstobusiness activity including initial round spending included direct effect induced effect result increased personal income caused direct indirect effect business experiencing increased revenue direct indirect effect subsequently increase payroll expenditure hiring employee increasing payroll hour raising salary etc household turn increase spending local business induced effect measure increase householdtobusiness activity finally dynamic effect caused geographic shift time population business method economic impact analysis usually employ one two method determining impact first inputoutput model io model analyzing regional economy model rely interindustry data determine effect one industry impact sector addition io model also estimate share industry purchase supplied local firm versus outside study area based data multiplier calculated used estimate economic impact example io model used economic impact analysis implan rimsii chmura emsi alocal solution another method used economic impact analysis economic simulation model complex econometric general equilibrium model account everything io model plus forecast impact caused future economic de
Solar equator,"The solar equator is the latitude on Earth at which the Sun is observed directly overhead at midday. Due to the obliquity of Earth's axis, the solar equator varies during the year, from the Tropic of Capricorn on the December solstice to the Tropic of Cancer on the June solstice. On the day of either equinox, the Sun's position is at the zenith when viewed from the geographic equator. The Sun can never be observed directly overhead from outside of the tropics.

Paris Theater (Manhattan),"The Paris Theater is a 535-seat single-screen art house movie theater, located in Manhattan in New York City. It opened on September 13, 1948. It often showed art films and foreign films in their original languages. Upon the 2016 closure of the Ziegfeld, the Paris became Manhattan's sole-surviving single-screen cinema. Since November 2019, it has been operated by Netflix, playing first-run releases alongside repertory programming.

History
The theater was opened by Pathé Cinema on September 13, 1948, when actress Marlene Dietrich cut the inaugural ribbon in the presence of the U.S. Ambassador to France.
It was designed by the New York architectural firm of Emery Roth & Sons. It was one of the first designs produced by Richard Roth when he reorganized the firm after returning from duty in the Pacific during World War II. He later co-designed the Pan Am Building and the World Trade Center.
Located at 4 West 58th Street in Midtown Manhattan, it has specialized in foreign (especially French language) and independent films. It is between the Solow Building and Bergdorf Goodman Building, across from the Plaza Hotel. The theater became a destination for motion pictures by directors including Federico Fellini and Franco Zeffirelli.
In 1990, Pathé lost its lease. Loews Theatres then took over the operation and it was known as the Fine Arts Theatre for a while. In 1994 the space was purchased by Sheldon Solow, a New York City–based real-estate developer and owner.
By 2009, City Cinemas was the theater's operator. After the Ziegfeld closed in January 2016, the Paris became Manhattan's sole surviving single-screen cinema. In August 2019, a notice of closure was posted. In November 2019, it was announced that the cinema would reopen for a limited run of Noah Baumbach's Marriage Story (2019). At that time, Netflix leased the Paris Theater to use it for Netflix-original movie debuts, special events and other screenings. The Paris closed temporarily in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, reopening in August 2021. During the closure, Netflix installed new seating and made other improvements to the facility, which reopened August 6, 2021.

Spatial justice,"Spatial justice links social justice to space, most notably in the works of geographers David Harvey and Edward W. Soja. The field analyzes the impact of regional planning and urban planning decisions. It is promoted by the scholarly tradition of critical geography, which arose in the 1970s.

Between issues of redistribution and decision-making processes
Building on the work of several famous Justice philosophers (John Rawls, 1971; Iris Marion Young, 1990, 2000), two contrasting approaches of justice have polarized the debate: one focuses on redistribution issues, the other concentrates on decision-making processes.
A first set of approaches consists in asking questions about spatial or socio-spatial distributions and working to achieve an equal geographical distribution of society's wants and needs, such as job opportunities, access to health care, good air quality, et cetera.  This is of particular concern in regions where the population has difficulty moving to a more spatially just location due to poverty, discrimination, or political restrictions (such as apartheid pass laws).  Even in free, developed nations, access to many places are limited.  Geographer Don Mitchell points to the mass privatization of once-public land as a common example of spatial injustice. In this distributive justice perspective, the access to material and immaterial goods, or to social positions indicates whether the situation is fair or not. At the scale of urban space, questions of accessibility, walkability and transport equity can also be seen as matters of distribution of spatial resources.
Another way of tackling the concept of spatial justice is to focus on decision-making procedures: this approach also raises issues of representations of space, of territorial or other identities and of social practices. For instance, focusing on minorities allows to explore their spatial practices but also to investigate how these are experienced and managed by various agents: this may lead to reveal forms of oppression or discrimination that a universalist approach might disregard otherwise. Architect and urbanist Liz Ogbu argues, for instance, that successful spatial justice planning requires designers to ""engage people who don’t have a seat at the table and think about them as co-designers in the process"".

Environmental justice
Environmental justice is a related concept, arising in the 1970s in North American cities. It criticizes the concentration of pollution and natural hazards disproportionately in minority neighborhoods, which is seen by proponents as a form of racial discrimination.

Synchronous lateral excitation,"Synchronous lateral excitation is a dynamic phenomenon where pedestrians walking on a footbridge subconsciously synchronize their lateral footsteps with the bridge’s natural swaying motion, amplifying lateral vibrations. First widely recognized during the 2000 opening of the London Millennium Bridge, synchronous lateral excitation has since become a critical consideration in the design of lightweight pedestrian structures.

Mechanism
Synchronous lateral excitation arises from two interrelated synchronization processes. The first is the pedestrian-structure synchronization, where slight lateral bridge movements (e.g., from wind or random pedestrian steps) prompt walkers to adjust their gait to match the bridge’s oscillation frequency, increasing lateral forces.
The second is pedestrian-pedestrian synchronization, where individuals unconsciously align their stepping patterns, further reinforcing the resonant force.

Key cases
The London Millennium Bridge experienced lateral vibrations up to 70 mm due to synchronous lateral excitation, requiring a £5M retrofit with dampers.
The Auckland Harbour Bridge experienced a lateral frequency of 0.67 Hz during a 1975 demonstration.
The Birmingham NEC Link bridge experienced a lateral frequency of 0.7 Hz.
The Toda Park Bridge in Japan is an early documented case (1990s) studied by Fujino et al., informing later synchronous lateral excitation models.

Mitigation strategies
Some ways to avoid synchronous lateral excitation are the implementation of tuned mass dampers, which were used in the Millennium Bridge to increase damping from 0.5% to 20% critical. Other strategies involve designing bridges with lateral frequencies outside the 0.5–1.1 Hz range as well as managing crows by limiting pedestrian density during events.

Billabong,"In Australian English, a billabong ( BIL-ə-bong) is a small body of water, usually permanent. It is usually an oxbow lake caused by a change in course of a river or creek, but other types of small lakes, ponds or waterholes are also called billabongs. The term is likely borrowed from Wiradjuri, an Aboriginal Australian language of New South Wales.

Etymology
The word billabong is most likely derived from the Wiradjuri language of southern New South Wales, which ""describes a pond or pool of water that is left behind when a river alters course or after floodwaters recede"". According to the Macquarie Dictionary (2005), the original term bilabaŋ means ""a watercourse that runs only after rain"", with bila meaning ""river"", and possibly combined with bong or bung, meaning ""dead"". The attribution of this last part of the word was contested in 2004 by Frederick Ludowyk of the Australian National Dictionary Centre, whose view was that that ""-bong"" or ""-bang"" was a suffix ""signifying a continuation in time or space"". Ludowyk writes that bong meaning ""dead"" is not a Wiradjuri word, but may have been picked up or assumed from the word ""bung"", which was originally a Yagara word used in the pidgin widely spoken across Australia.
The word is first recorded in Australian English in 1836, referring to the Bell River in south-eastern New South Wales, when explorer Thomas Mitchell records the Aboriginal name of the river as ""Billibang"". It is first recorded in its later, more general sense, by J. Allen in 1853: ""This station is situated about half-a-mile inland, over a 'billy-bong' (the native name for a small creek or backwater)"". It is not recorded in the first edition of the Oxford English Dictionary (prepared 1882–1888), published before the later contributions of the Australian academic Edward Ellis Morris. It appears in Morris's Austral English: A Dictionary of Australasian Words (1898).
A 2004 thesis suggests that the term could be of Scottish Gaelic origin, derived from words for ""lip"" or ""mouth"" and ""river"".

Definitions and descriptions
Definitions vary. A  billabong is often defined as an oxbow lake, an isolated crescentic pond left behind after a river loop is cut off when the river channel changes course.
Merriam-Webster defines the word as: ""1. (a) a blind channel leading out from a river; (b) a usually dry streambed that is filled seasonally"", or 2. ""a backwater forming a stagnant pool"" The Cambridge Dictionary describes it as ""In Australia, a low area of ground that was part of a river in the past and that only fills up with water from the river during a flood"".
In a 2009 study, billabongs of the Channel Country (a region of outback Australia whose name derives from the numerous intertwined rivulets that cross it) are alternatively termed waterholes, and described as ""enlarged channel segments along the main course of the river... typically occur[ring] at the confluence of two smaller channels"".
Queensland's Department of Environment, Science and Innovation, in its Queensland Waterhole Classification Scheme, describes waterholes as ""referred to by a range of different names (i.e. billabongs, lagoons and waterbodies)"".
Another source describes a billabong as ""a large body of water"", which may be formed from a section of cut-off river, but may also be formed from water left behind after a large flood.
Billabongs are usually formed when the path of a creek or river changes due to bank erosion, leaving the former channel deprived of further inflow and becoming a dead-end gully holding only residual water that has not yet drained or evaporated.  As a result of the arid climate of many parts of Australia, these ""dead rivers"" often fill with water seasonally but can be dry for a greater part of the year.

Significance
To people
Many billabongs are of cultural significance and social importance to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and used as sources of fresh water as well as other resources.  Water is an intrinsic part of Country, and essential resource during drought or dry seasons, and they have many intricate ways of understanding how to find water.
The Ngan'gi peoples in the Daly River region of the Northern Territory continue to manage the billabongs' ecology in their Country.
Water-holding frogs living in the billabongs can take up a lot of water before it burrows into the earth in the dry season, and Aboriginal peoples in desert environments can locate the frogs underground by various means.
In the days since the colonisation of Australia, these were important landmarks for European settlers to identify, and many billabongs were given names relating to the local areas.

Stylistics,"Stylistics, a branch of applied linguistics, is the study and interpretation of texts of all types, but particularly literary texts, and spoken language with regard to their linguistic and tonal style, where style is the particular variety of language used by different individuals in different situations and settings. For example, the vernacular, or everyday language, may be used among casual friends, whereas more formal language, with respect to grammar, pronunciation or accent, and lexicon or choice of words, is often used in a cover letter and résumé and while speaking during a job interview.
As a discipline, stylistics links literary criticism to linguistics. It does not function as an autonomous domain on its own, and it can be applied to an understanding of literature and journalism as well as linguistics. Sources of study in stylistics may range from canonical works of writing to popular texts, and from advertising copy to news, non-fiction, and popular culture, as well as to political and religious discourse. Indeed, as recent work in critical stylistics, multimodal stylistics and mediated stylistics has made clear, non-literary texts may be of just as much interest to stylisticians as literary ones. Literariness, in other words, is here conceived as 'a point on a cline rather than as an absolute'.
Stylistics as a conceptual discipline may attempt to establish principles capable of explaining particular choices made by individuals and social groups in their use of language, such as in the literary production and reception of genre, the study of folk art, in the study of spoken dialects and registers, and can be applied to areas such as discourse analysis as well as literary criticism.
Plain language has different features.
Common stylistic features are using dialogue, regional accents and individual idioms (or idiolects). Stylistically, also sentence length prevalence and language register use.

Early twentieth century
The analysis of literary style goes back to the study of classical rhetoric, though modern stylistics has its roots in Russian Formalism and the related Prague School of the early twentieth century.
In 1909, Charles Bally proposed stylistics as a distinct academic discipline to complement Saussurean linguistics. For Bally, Saussure's linguistics by itself couldn't fully describe the language of personal expression. Bally's programme fits well with the aims of the Prague School.
Taking forward the ideas of the Russian Formalists, the Prague School built on the concept of foregrounding, where it is assumed that poetic language is considered to stand apart from non-literary background language, by means of  deviation (from the norms of everyday language) or parallelism. According to the Prague School, however, this background language isn't constant, and the relationship between poetic and everyday language is therefore always shifting.

Late twentieth century
Roman Jakobson had been an active member of the Russian Formalists and the Prague School, before emigrating to America in the 1940s. He brought together Russian Formalism and American New Criticism in his Closing Statement at a conference on stylistics at Indiana University in 1958. Published as Linguistics and Poetics in 1960, Jakobson's lecture is often credited with being the first coherent formulation of stylistics, and his argument was that the study of poetic language should be a sub-branch of linguistics. The poetic function was one of six general functions of language he described in the lecture.
Michael Halliday is an important figure in the development of British stylistics. His 1971 study Linguistic Function and Literary Style: An Inquiry into the Language of William Golding's The Inheritors is a key essay. One of Halliday's contributions has been the use of the term register to explain the connections between language and its context. For Halliday register is distinct from dialect. Dialect refers to the habitual language of a particular user in a specific geographical or social context. Register describes the choices made by the user, choices which depend on three variables: field (""what the participants... are actually engaged in doing"", for instance, discussing a specific subject or topic), tenor (who is taking part in the exchange) and mode (the use to which the language is being put).
Fowler comments that different fields produce different language, most obviously at the level of vocabulary (Fowler. 1996, 192) The linguist David Crystal points out that Halliday's 'tenor' stands as a roughly equivalent term for 'style', which is a more specific alternative used by linguists to avoid ambiguity (Crystal. 1985, 292). Halliday's third category, mode, is what he refers to as the symbolic organisation of the situation. Downes recognises two distinct aspects within the category of mode and suggests that not only does it describe the relation to the medium: written, spoken, and so on, but also describes the genre of the text",Literature,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylistics,0,stylistics branch applied linguistics study interpretation text type particularly literary text spoken language regard linguistic tonal style style particular variety language used different individual different situation setting example vernacular everyday language may used among casual friend whereas formal language respect grammar pronunciation accent lexicon choice word often used cover letter résumé speaking job interview discipline stylistics link literary criticism linguistics function autonomous domain applied understanding literature journalism well linguistics source study stylistics may range canonical work writing popular text advertising copy news nonfiction popular culture well political religious discourse indeed recent work critical stylistics multimodal stylistics mediated stylistics made clear nonliterary text may much interest stylisticians literary one literariness word conceived point cline rather absolute stylistics conceptual discipline may attempt establish principle capable explaining particular choice made individual social group use language literary production reception genre study folk art study spoken dialect register applied area discourse analysis well literary criticism plain language different feature common stylistic feature using dialogue regional accent individual idiom idiolect stylistically also sentence length prevalence language register use early twentieth century analysis literary style go back study classical rhetoric though modern stylistics root russian formalism related prague school early twentieth century charles bally proposed stylistics distinct academic discipline complement saussurean linguistics bally saussure linguistics couldnt fully describe language personal expression ballys programme fit well aim prague school taking forward idea russian formalists prague school built concept foregrounding assumed poetic language considered stand apart nonliterary background language mean deviation norm everyday language parallelism according prague school however background language isnt constant relationship poetic everyday language therefore always shifting late twentieth century roman jakobson active member russian formalists prague school emigrating america brought together russian formalism american new criticism closing statement conference stylistics indiana university published linguistics poetics jakobson lecture often credited first coherent formulation stylistics argument study poetic language subbranch linguistics poetic function one six general function language described lecture michael halliday important figure development british stylistics study linguistic function literary style inquiry language william golding inheritor key essay one hallidays contribution use term register explain connection language context halliday register distinct dialect dialect refers habitual language particular user specific geographical social context register describes choice made user choice depend three variable field participant actually engaged instance discussing specific subject topic tenor taking part exchange mode use language put fowler comment different field produce different language obviously level vocabulary fowler linguist david crystal point hallidays tenor stand roughly equivalent term style specific alternative used linguist avoid ambiguity crystal hallidays third category mode refers symbolic organisation situation downes recognises two distinct aspect within category mode suggests describe relation medium written spoken also describes genre text
Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics,"The  Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics, or OHDSI (pronounced ""Odyssey"") is an international collaborative effort aimed at improving health outcomes through large-scale analytics of health data. The OHDSI effort includes diverse researchers and health databases worldwide, with its central coordinating center located at Columbia University.
The group was derived from the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP), a public-private consortium based in the United States of America, created with the goal of improving the state of observational health data for better drug development, which started in response to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Amendments Act of 2007. OMOP developed a Common Data Model (CDM), standardizing the way observational data is represented. After OMOP ended, this standard started being maintained and updated by OHDSI.
As of February 2024, the most recent CDM is at version 6.0, while version 5.4 is the stable version used by most tools in the OMOP ecosystem.

Data science,"Data science is an interdisciplinary academic field that uses statistics, scientific computing, scientific methods, processing, scientific visualization, algorithms and systems to extract or extrapolate knowledge from potentially noisy, structured, or unstructured data. 
Data science also integrates domain knowledge from the underlying application domain (e.g., natural sciences, information technology, and medicine). Data science is multifaceted and can be described as a science, a research paradigm, a research method, a discipline, a workflow, and a profession.
Data science is ""a concept to unify statistics, data analysis, informatics, and their related methods"" to ""understand and analyze actual phenomena"" with data. It uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, information science, and domain knowledge. However, data science is different from computer science and information science. Turing Award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a ""fourth paradigm"" of science (empirical, theoretical, computational, and now data-driven) and asserted that ""everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology"" and the data deluge.
A data scientist is a professional who creates programming code and combines it with statistical knowledge to summarize data.

Foundations
Data science is an interdisciplinary field focused on extracting knowledge from typically large data sets and applying the knowledge from that data to solve problems in other application domains. The field encompasses preparing data for analysis, formulating data science problems, analyzing data, and summarizing these findings. As such, it incorporates skills from computer science, mathematics, data visualization, graphic design, communication, and business.
Vasant Dhar writes that statistics emphasizes quantitative data and description. In contrast, data science deals with quantitative and qualitative data (e.g., from images, text, sensors, transactions, customer information, etc.) and emphasizes prediction and action. Andrew Gelman of Columbia University has described statistics as a non-essential part of data science. Stanford professor David Donoho writes that data science is not distinguished from statistics by the size of datasets or use of computing and that many graduate programs misleadingly advertise their analytics and statistics training as the essence of a data-science program. He describes data science as an applied field growing out of traditional statistics.

Etymology
Early usage
In 1962, John Tukey described a field he called ""data analysis"", which resembles modern data science. In 1985, in a lecture given to the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, C. F. Jeff Wu used the term ""data science"" for the first time as an alternative name for statistics. Later, attendees at a 1992 statistics symposium at the University of Montpellier  II acknowledged the emergence of a new discipline focused on data of various origins and forms, combining established concepts and principles of statistics and data analysis with computing.
The term ""data science"" has been traced back to 1974, when Peter Naur proposed it as an alternative name to computer science. In 1996, the International Federation of Classification Societies became the first conference to specifically feature data science as a topic. However, the definition was still in flux. After the 1985 lecture at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, in 1997 C. F. Jeff Wu again suggested that statistics should be renamed data science. He reasoned that a new name would help statistics shed inaccurate stereotypes, such as being synonymous with accounting or limited to describing data. In 1998, Hayashi Chikio argued for data science as a new, interdisciplinary concept, with three aspects: data design, collection, and analysis.

Modern usage
In 2012, technologists Thomas H. Davenport and DJ Patil declared ""Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century"", a catchphrase that was picked up even by major-city newspapers like the New York Times and the Boston Globe. A decade later, they reaffirmed it, stating that ""the job is more in demand than ever with employers"".
The modern conception of data science as an independent discipline is sometimes attributed to William S. Cleveland. In 2014, the American Statistical Association's Section on Statistical Learning and Data Mining changed its name to the Section on Statistical Learning and Data Science, reflecting the ascendant popularity of data science.
The professional title of ""data scientist"" has been attributed to DJ Patil and Jeff Hammerbacher in 2008. Though it was used by the National Science Board in their 2005 report ""Long-Lived Digital Data Collections: Enabling Research and Education in the 21st Century"", it referred broadly to any key role in managing a digital data collection.

Derrick's sandbank,"Derrick's sandbank is an island in the Seychelles that emerged following a cyclone in 2016. Its surface area expanded over the following years to reach nearly 8 hectares.

Geography
The island is located in the Farquhar group, which is part of the Outer Islands of the Seychelles. It is a sandbank whose surface and vegetation are growing. Its emergence is occurring in the context of coastal erosion in the archipelago and the destruction of coral reefs due to climate change.

History
Derrick's sandbank appeared following Cyclone Fantala, which struck the region in mid-April 2016. Its initial area was 0.3 hectares, and it wasn't until 2019 that its elevation was consistently higher than the high tide level. Its permanence was also confirmed by the colonization of shrubs and birds. A study conducted in 2023 showed that the area had increased to 7.8 hectares.

Conurbation,"A conurbation is a region consisting of a number of metropolises, cities, large towns, and other urban areas which, through population growth and physical expansion, have merged to form one continuous urban or industrially developed area. In most cases, a conurbation is a polycentric urbanised area in which transportation has developed to link areas. They create a single urban labour market or travel to work area.
Conurbations often emerged in coal-mining regions during the period of the Industrial Revolution.
Patrick Geddes coined the term in his book Cities in Evolution (1915). He drew attention to the ability of the new technology at the time of electric power and motorised transport to allow cities to spread and agglomerate together, and gave as examples ""Midlandton"" in England, the Ruhr in Germany, Randstad in the Netherlands, and the Northeastern Seaboard in the United States.
For census purposes, the term as described is used in Britain, whereas in the United States a related concept of metropolitan area is used instead. Each polycentric ""metropolitan area"" may have its own common designation such as San Francisco Bay Area or the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. Internationally the term ""urban agglomeration"" is often used to convey a similar meaning to ""conurbation"".
A conurbation is different from a megalopolis in that the urban areas of a megalopolis are close but not physically contiguous, and labor markets have not yet merged. The region structure should also be contrasted with a megacity, as a megacity is hierarchical with a dominant urban core, whereas a conurbation is polycentric and no single urban centre has the dominant role over all other centres.

Island ecology,"Island ecology is the study of island organisms and their interactions with each other and the environment.  Islands account for nearly 1/6 of earth’s total land area, yet the ecology of island ecosystems is vastly different from that of mainland communities.  Their isolation and high availability of empty niches lead to increased speciation.  As a result, island ecosystems comprise 30% of the world’s biodiversity hotspots, 50% of marine tropical diversity, and some of the most unusual and rare species.  Many species still remain unknown.
The diversity of species on islands is highly impacted by human activities such as deforestation and introduction of the exotic species.  In response, ecologists and managers are directing attention towards conservation and restoration of island species.  Because they are simple systems, islands provide an opportunity to study processes of extinction that can be extrapolated to larger ecosystems.

Ecological processes on islands
Islands are attractive sites for ecological research because they provide clear examples of evolution in action.  They show interesting patterns of colonization, adaptation, and speciation.

Colonization and establishment
Islands are surrounded by water, and may or may not exist as part of a continental land mass.  Oceanic islands arise due to volcanic activity or reef growth, and usually subside over time due to erosion and changing sea levels.  When islands emerge, they undergo the process of ecological succession as species colonize the island (see theory of island biogeography).  New species cannot immigrate via land, and instead must arrive via air, water, or wind.  As a result, organisms with high dispersal capabilities, such as plants and birds, are much more common on islands than are poorly dispersing taxa like mammals.  However, some mammals are present on islands, presumably from swimming or riding on natural “rafts” that are washed away from the mainland.
Of the species that arrive, only some will be able to survive and establish populations.  As a result, islands have fewer species than mainland habitats.  Island populations are small and exhibit low genetic variability (see founder effect), but are isolated from the predators and competitors that they initially evolved with.  This can lead to a process called ecological release, where a species is released from its ancestral community interactions and then colonizes new niches.

Adaptation
In response to these changing ecological pressures, island species can become much more docile than their mainland counterparts, and may grow larger (see island gigantism) or smaller (see island dwarfism).  Some of these unique adaptations are reflected in charismatic island species such as the Malagasy hippopotamus, Komodo dragon, or pygmy mammoths. Although, the giant tortoises of the Galápagos Islands and the Seychelles (the Galápagos tortoise and Aldabrachelys respectively) are sometimes given as examples of insular gigantism, they are now thought to represent the last remaining populations of historically widespread giant tortoises i.e. gigantism is an ancestral trait that occurred in the absence of insular selection pressures. The collection of differences in morphology, ecology, physiology and behaviour of insular species compared to their continental counterparts is termed Island syndrome.

 After immigration, birds, and some reptiles or mammals, tend to become larger and predatory, showing relaxed intraspecific competition.  For mammals, small species will increase in size and large species will decrease in size.  This is referred to as the “island rule,” and is suggested to minimize energy expenditure.
Other adaptations to life on islands include increased poikilothermy, relaxed anti-predator behavior, and reduced sexual selection in animals, and loss of herbivore defenses and reduced dispersal in plants.

Speciation
The formation of new islands and their isolation from the mainland provides many unoccupied niches for species to adapt to.  Since immigration of predators and competitors is limited, many organisms are able to persist in these new niches.  This results in a high occurrence of endemism, where species are unique to a localized area.  For example, 50% of endemic bird areas are found on islands.

Endemism is often the result of adaptive radiation.  Adaptive radiation is when a single species colonizes an area and rapidly diversifies to fill all of the available niches.  A common example is the assemblage of finch species documented by Charles Darwin in the Galapagos Islands.  Darwin’s finches exhibited adaptive radiation by evolving different beak sizes to exploit the diversity of seeds present on the different islands.  
Because the distributions of these populations are limited by their island habitats, they tend to have fewer individuals than their mainland counterparts and lower genetic variation.  This, along with the behavioral and ecological factors mentioned above, makes ",Islands,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_ecology,1,island ecology study island organism interaction environment island account nearly earth ’ total land area yet ecology island ecosystem vastly different mainland community isolation high availability empty niche lead increased speciation result island ecosystem comprise world ’ biodiversity hotspot marine tropical diversity unusual rare specie many specie still remain unknown diversity specie island highly impacted human activity deforestation introduction exotic specie response ecologist manager directing attention towards conservation restoration island specie simple system island provide opportunity study process extinction extrapolated larger ecosystem ecological process island island attractive site ecological research provide clear example evolution action show interesting pattern colonization adaptation speciation colonization establishment island surrounded water may may exist part continental land mass oceanic island arise due volcanic activity reef growth usually subside time due erosion changing sea level island emerge undergo process ecological succession specie colonize island see theory island biogeography new specie immigrate via land instead must arrive via air water wind result organism high dispersal capability plant bird much common island poorly dispersing taxon like mammal however mammal present island presumably swimming riding natural “ raft ” washed away mainland specie arrive able survive establish population result island fewer specie mainland habitat island population small exhibit low genetic variability see founder effect isolated predator competitor initially evolved lead process called ecological release specie released ancestral community interaction colonizes new niche adaptation response changing ecological pressure island specie become much docile mainland counterpart may grow larger see island gigantism smaller see island dwarfism unique adaptation reflected charismatic island specie malagasy hippopotamus komodo dragon pygmy mammoth although giant tortoise galápagos island seychelles galápagos tortoise aldabrachelys respectively sometimes given example insular gigantism thought represent last remaining population historically widespread giant tortoise ie gigantism ancestral trait occurred absence insular selection pressure collection difference morphology ecology physiology behaviour insular specie compared continental counterpart termed island syndrome immigration bird reptile mammal tend become larger predatory showing relaxed intraspecific competition mammal small specie increase size large specie decrease size referred “ island rule ” suggested minimize energy expenditure adaptation life island include increased poikilothermy relaxed antipredator behavior reduced sexual selection animal loss herbivore defense reduced dispersal plant speciation formation new island isolation mainland provides many unoccupied niche specie adapt since immigration predator competitor limited many organism able persist new niche result high occurrence endemism specie unique localized area example endemic bird area found island endemism often result adaptive radiation adaptive radiation single specie colonizes area rapidly diversifies fill available niche common example assemblage finch specie documented charles darwin galapagos island darwin ’ finch exhibited adaptive radiation evolving different beak size exploit diversity seed present different island distribution population limited island habitat tend fewer individual mainland counterpart lower genetic variation along behavioral ecological factor mentioned make
Endorheic basin,"An endorheic basin ( EN-doh-REE-ik; also endoreic basin and endorreic basin) is a drainage basin that normally retains water and allows no outflow to other external bodies of water (e.g. rivers and oceans); instead, the water drainage flows into permanent and seasonal lakes and swamps that equilibrate through evaporation. Endorheic basins are also called closed basins, terminal basins, and internal drainage systems.
Endorheic regions contrast with open lakes (exorheic regions), where surface waters eventually drain into the ocean. In general, water basins with subsurface outflows that lead to the ocean are not considered endorheic; but cryptorheic. Endorheic basins constitute local base levels, defining a limit of the erosion and deposition processes of nearby areas. Endorheic water bodies include the Caspian Sea, which is the world's largest inland body of water.

Etymology
The term endorheic derives from the French word endoréisme, which combines endo- (Ancient Greek: ἔνδον éndon 'within') and ῥεῖν rheîn 'flow'.

Endorheic lakes
Endorheic lakes (terminal lakes) are bodies of water that do not flow into an ocean or a sea. Most of the water that falls to Earth percolates into the oceans and the seas by way of a network of rivers, lakes, and wetlands. Analogous to endorheic lakes is the class of bodies of water located in closed watersheds (endorheic watersheds) where the local topography prevents the drainage of water into the oceans and the seas. These endorheic watersheds (containing water in rivers or lakes that form a balance of surface inflows, evaporation and seepage) are often called sinks.
Endorheic lakes are typically located in the interior of a landmass, far from an ocean, and in areas of relatively low rainfall. Their watersheds are often confined by natural geologic land formations such as a mountain range, cutting off water egress to the ocean. The inland water flows into dry watersheds where the water evaporates, leaving a high concentration of minerals and other inflow erosion products. Over time this input of erosion products can cause the endorheic lake to become relatively saline (a ""salt lake""). Since the main outflow pathways of these lakes are chiefly through evaporation and seepage, endorheic lakes are usually more sensitive to environmental pollutant inputs than water bodies that have access to oceans, as pollution can be trapped in them and accumulate over time.

Occurrence
Endorheic regions can occur in any climate but are most commonly found in desert locations. This reflects the balance between tectonic subsidence and rates of evaporation and sedimentation. Where the basin floor is dropping more rapidly than water and sediments can accumulate, any lake in the basin will remain below the sill level (the level at which water can find a path out of the basin). Low rainfall or rapid evaporation in the watershed favor this case. In areas where rainfall is higher, riparian erosion will generally carve drainage channels (particularly in times of flood), or cause the water level in the terminal lake to rise until it finds an outlet, breaking the enclosed endorheic hydrological system's geographical barrier and opening it to the surrounding terrain. The Black Sea was likely such a lake, having once been an independent hydrological system before the Mediterranean Sea broke through the terrain separating the two. Lake Bonneville was another such lake, overflowing its basin in the Bonneville flood. The Malheur/Harney lake system in Oregon is normally cut off from drainage to the ocean, but has an outflow channel to the Malheur River. This is presently dry, but may have flowed as recently as 1,000 years ago.
Examples of relatively humid regions in endorheic basins often exist at high elevation. These regions tend to be marshy and are subject to substantial flooding in wet years. The area containing Mexico City is one such case, with annual precipitation of 850 mm (33 in) and characterized by waterlogged soils that require draining.
Endorheic regions tend to be far inland with their boundaries defined by mountains or other geological features that block their access to oceans. Since the inflowing water can evacuate only through seepage or evaporation, dried minerals or other products collect in the basin, eventually making the water saline and also making the basin vulnerable to pollution. Continents vary in their concentration of endorheic regions due to conditions of geography and climate. Australia has the highest percentage of endorheic regions at 21 per cent while North America has the least at five per cent. Approximately 18 per cent of the Earth's land drains to endorheic lakes or seas, the largest of these land areas being the interior of Asia.
In deserts, water inflow is low and loss to solar evaporation high, drastically reducing the formation of complete drainage systems. In the extreme case, where there is no discernible drainage system, the basin is described as arheic.

Spatial citizenship,"Spatial citizenship describes the ability of individuals and groups to interact and participate in societal spatial decision making through the reflexive production and use of geo-media (geographic media such as maps, virtual globes, GIS, and the Geoweb). Spatial citizens are lay users who are able to use geo-media to question existing perspectives on action in space (e.g. social rules, spatial planning) and to produce, communicate, and negotiate alternative spatial visions.
Spatial citizenship is an educational approach at the intersection of citizenship education and geography education. Its main theoretical reference points are emancipatory forms of citizenship and the ""reflexive appropriation of space"".

Reference points in citizenship education
Spatial citizenship can be distinguished from traditional citizenship education approaches in many respects: 

Spatial citizenship respects multiple institutional and locational setups. It is de-linked from traditional national ""citizenship"" as it is not tied to the nation or local state as predefined spatial entities. Spatial citizenship is based upon the principles of human rights and democratic negotiation to ensure a basis for conciliation and compromise. It is based on the concept of activist citizenship (in contrast to active citizenship) formulated by Katharyne Mitchell and Sarah Elwood, who challenge unquestioned social rules that limit participation.
Spatial citizenship refers to an open and flexible conception of social institutions. It supplants the notion of belonging to one specific place with the notion of belonging to multiple and fluid communities that may or may not be linked with a particular location on the Earth's surface. Angharad Stephens and Vicki Squire have argued that societal negotiation processes have shifted away from fixed communities due to new information technologies.
Spatial citizenship draws special attention to web communities and geo-social networks. A spatial citizen is a 'self-actualizing citizen' who, in contrast to the 'dutiful citizen' concept of the past, is able to use Web 2.0 and cloud-based applications to compare different and potentially contradicting information sources and communicate his/her own alternative ideas via collaborative web tools.

Reference points in social geography: appropriation of space
Spatial citizenship has become a conceptual reference point in theories of action-oriented social geography and new cultural geography. These approaches contend that human beings constantly appropriate spaces, as they attach meanings to geographically located physical matter in order to prepare it for their own actions.
In these theories, spaces are regarded as being socially constructed. To a large extent, the attachment of meaning works unconsciously, following socially accepted, mainstream categories and discourses. Meanings given to physical objects determine the actions deemed possible. For instance, a field of asphalt in a city centre might have multiple meanings: it may be interpreted as a parking area as well as a place for ball games, with both meanings competing for dominance. As soon as one meaning becomes superior, which is a result of social power relations, the other meaning may decline, become invisible, and eventually is not used anymore. The superiority of a specific meaning over another one might be supported by artifacts representing meanings attached, such as signs on buildings, structural modifications of the physical environment, or symbols and explanations of the socio-cultural significance of places and objects in spatial representations visualized via geo-media.
A mature appropriation of space therefore includes the conscious attachment of meaning as well as awareness of meanings being attached to places by others. It includes a sensibility to the multitude of meanings transported and hidden by a mainstream discourse. Keys to the mature appropriation of space are therefore the deconstruction of socially produced meanings, as well as the ability to communicate one's own, potentially contradictory meanings and negotiate them with others. This process is often mediated through the formation of a collective spatialized identity. Given that space – its uses and symbolic significance – is often the site of social and political struggle, it becomes the container for action while at the same time shaping the group development of a ""us"". In particular, when groups re-imagine public space for political usages, this expression of spatial citizenship is the outcome of a spatially informed collective identity.

Spatial citizenship in the geoinformation society
Geographic media (geo-media) are especially important for attaching meaning to places as they clearly connect location, information and visualization. In addition to this, geo-media represents mainly single meanings out of the many that are possible. Nowadays, geo-media have become more and more present in everyday life due to mobile computing in",Geography,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_citizenship,1,spatial citizenship describes ability individual group interact participate societal spatial decision making reflexive production use geomedia geographic medium map virtual globe gi geoweb spatial citizen lay user able use geomedia question existing perspective action space eg social rule spatial planning produce communicate negotiate alternative spatial vision spatial citizenship educational approach intersection citizenship education geography education main theoretical reference point emancipatory form citizenship reflexive appropriation space reference point citizenship education spatial citizenship distinguished traditional citizenship education approach many respect spatial citizenship respect multiple institutional locational setup delinked traditional national citizenship tied nation local state predefined spatial entity spatial citizenship based upon principle human right democratic negotiation ensure basis conciliation compromise based concept activist citizenship contrast active citizenship formulated katharyne mitchell sarah elwood challenge unquestioned social rule limit participation spatial citizenship refers open flexible conception social institution supplants notion belonging one specific place notion belonging multiple fluid community may may linked particular location earth surface angharad stephen vicki squire argued societal negotiation process shifted away fixed community due new information technology spatial citizenship draw special attention web community geosocial network spatial citizen selfactualizing citizen contrast dutiful citizen concept past able use web cloudbased application compare different potentially contradicting information source communicate hisher alternative idea via collaborative web tool reference point social geography appropriation space spatial citizenship become conceptual reference point theory actionoriented social geography new cultural geography approach contend human being constantly appropriate space attach meaning geographically located physical matter order prepare action theory space regarded socially constructed large extent attachment meaning work unconsciously following socially accepted mainstream category discourse meaning given physical object determine action deemed possible instance field asphalt city centre might multiple meaning may interpreted parking area well place ball game meaning competing dominance soon one meaning becomes superior result social power relation meaning may decline become invisible eventually used anymore superiority specific meaning another one might supported artifact representing meaning attached sign building structural modification physical environment symbol explanation sociocultural significance place object spatial representation visualized via geomedia mature appropriation space therefore includes conscious attachment meaning well awareness meaning attached place others includes sensibility multitude meaning transported hidden mainstream discourse key mature appropriation space therefore deconstruction socially produced meaning well ability communicate one potentially contradictory meaning negotiate others process often mediated formation collective spatialized identity given space – us symbolic significance – often site social political struggle becomes container action time shaping group development u particular group reimagine public space political usage expression spatial citizenship outcome spatially informed collective identity spatial citizenship geoinformation society geographic medium geomedia especially important attaching meaning place clearly connect location information visualization addition geomedia represents mainly single meaning many possible nowadays geomedia become present everyday life due mobile computing
Artificial intelligence,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.
High-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); virtual assistants (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., ChatGPT and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: ""A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore.""
Various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include learning, reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields. Some companies, such as OpenAI, Google DeepMind and Meta, aim to create artificial general intelligence (AGI)—AI that can complete virtually any cognitive task at least as well as a human.
Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history, followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winters. Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when graphics processing units started being used to accelerate neural networks, and deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques. This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture. In the 2020s, the period of rapid progress marked by advanced generative AI became known as the AI boom. Generative AI and its ability to create and modify content exposed several unintended consequences and harms in the present and raised ethical concerns about AI's long-term effects and potential existential risks, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.

Goals
The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into subproblems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research.

Reasoning and problem-solving
Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions. By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics.
Many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a ""combinatorial explosion"": They become exponentially slower as the problems grow. Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments. Accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem.

Knowledge representation
Knowledge representation and knowledge engineering allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts. Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval, scene interpretation, clinical decision support, knowledge discovery (mining ""interesting"" and actionable inferences from large databases), and other areas.
A knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program. An ontology is the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge. Knowledge bases need to represent things such as objects, properties, categories, and relations between objects; situations, events, states, and time; causes and effects; knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know); default reasoning (things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing); and many other aspects and domains of knowledge.
Among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the breadth of commonsense knowledge (th",data science,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence,0,artificial intelligence ai capability computational system perform task typically associated human intelligence learning reasoning problemsolving perception decisionmaking field research computer science develops study method software enable machine perceive environment use learning intelligence take action maximize chance achieving defined goal highprofile application ai include advanced web search engine eg google search recommendation system used youtube amazon netflix virtual assistant eg google assistant siri alexa autonomous vehicle eg waymo generative creative tool eg chatgpt ai art superhuman play analysis strategy game eg chess go however many ai application perceived ai lot cutting edge ai filtered general application often without called ai something becomes useful enough common enough labeled ai anymore various subfields ai research centered around particular goal use particular tool traditional goal ai research include learning reasoning knowledge representation planning natural language processing perception support robotics reach goal ai researcher adapted integrated wide range technique including search mathematical optimization formal logic artificial neural network method based statistic operation research economics ai also draw upon psychology linguistics philosophy neuroscience field company openai google deepmind meta aim create artificial general intelligence agi—ai complete virtually cognitive task least well human artificial intelligence founded academic discipline field went multiple cycle optimism throughout history followed period disappointment loss funding known ai winter funding interest vastly increased graphic processing unit started used accelerate neural network deep learning outperformed previous ai technique growth accelerated transformer architecture period rapid progress marked advanced generative ai became known ai boom generative ai ability create modify content exposed several unintended consequence harm present raised ethical concern ai longterm effect potential existential risk prompting discussion regulatory policy ensure safety benefit technology goal general problem simulating creating intelligence broken subproblems consist particular trait capability researcher expect intelligent system display trait described received attention cover scope ai research reasoning problemsolving early researcher developed algorithm imitated stepbystep reasoning human use solve puzzle make logical deduction late method developed dealing uncertain incomplete information employing concept probability economics many algorithm insufficient solving large reasoning problem experience combinatorial explosion become exponentially slower problem grow even human rarely use stepbystep deduction early ai research could model solve problem using fast intuitive judgment accurate efficient reasoning unsolved problem knowledge representation knowledge representation knowledge engineering allow ai program answer question intelligently make deduction realworld fact formal knowledge representation used contentbased indexing retrieval scene interpretation clinical decision support knowledge discovery mining interesting actionable inference large database area knowledge base body knowledge represented form used program ontology set object relation concept property used particular domain knowledge knowledge base need represent thing object property category relation object situation event state time cause effect knowledge knowledge know people know default reasoning thing human assume true told differently remain true even fact changing many aspect domain knowledge among difficult problem knowledge representation breadth commonsense knowledge th
Wind generated current,"A Wind generated current is a flow in a body of water that is generated by wind friction on its surface. Wind can generate surface currents on water bodies of any size. The depth and strength of the current depend on the wind strength and duration, and on friction and viscosity losses, but are limited to about 400 m depth by the mechanism, and to lesser depths where the water is shallower. The direction of flow is influenced by the Coriolis effect, and is offset to the right of the wind direction in the Northern Hemisphere, and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. A wind current can induce secondary water flow in the form of upwelling and downwelling, geostrophic flow, and western boundary currents.

Mechanism
Friction between wind and the upper surface of a body of water will drag the water surface along with the wind The surface layer will exert viscous drag on the water just below, which will transfer some of the momentum. This process continues downward, with a continuous reduction in speed of flow with increasing depth as the energy is dissipated. The inertial effect of planetary rotation causes an offset of flow direction with increasing depth to the right in the northern hemisphere and to the left in the southern hemisphere. The mechanism of deflection is called the Coriolis effect, and the variation of flow velocity with depth is called an Ekman spiral. The effect varies with latitude, being very weak at the equator and increasing in strength with latitude. The resultant flow of water caused by this mechanism is known as Ekman transport.
A steady wind blowing across a long fetch in deep water for long enough to establish a steady state flow causes the surface water to move at 45° to the wind direction. The variation in flow direction with depth has the water moving perpendicular to wind direction by about 100 to 150 m depth, and flow speed drops to about 4% of surface flow speed by the depth of about 330 to 400 m where the flow direction is opposite to wind direction, below which the effect of wind on the current is considered negligible. The net flow of water over the effective thickness of the current in these conditions is perpendicular to wind direction. Consistent prevailing winds set up persistent circulating surface currents in both hemispheres, and where the current is bounded by continental land masses, the resulting gyres are restricted in longitudinal extent. Seasonal and local winds cause smaller scale and generally transient currents, which dissipate after the driving winds die down.
Real conditions often differ, as wind strength and direction vary, and the depth may not be sufficient for the full spiral to develop, so that the angle between wind direction and surface-water movement can be as small as 15°. In deeper water, the angle increases and approaches 45°. A stable pycnocline can inhibit transfer of kinetic energy to deeper waters, providing a depth limit for surface currents.
The net inward shallow water flow in a gyre causes the surface level to gradually slope upwards towards the centre. This induces a horizontal pressure gradient which leads to a balancing geostrophic flow.

Boundary currents
Boundary currents are ocean currents with dynamics determined by the presence of a coastline, and fall into two distinct categories: 
Eastern boundary currents are relatively shallow, broad and slow-flowing currents on the eastern side of oceanic basins along the western coasts of continents. Subtropical eastern boundary currents flow equatorward, transporting cold water from higher latitudes to lower latitudes; examples include the Benguela Current, the Canary Current, the Humboldt Current, and the California Current. Coastal upwelling caused by offshore flow due to Ekman transport where the prevailing wind parallels the shoreline brings nutrient-rich water into eastern boundary current regions, making them highly productive areas.
Western boundary currents are warm, deep, narrow, and fast flowing currents that form on the west side of ocean basins due to western intensification. They carry warm water from the tropics poleward.  Examples include the Gulf Stream, the Agulhas Current, and the Kuroshio.
Western intensification is an effect on the western arm of an oceanic current,  particularly a large gyre in an ocean basin.  The trade winds blow westward in the tropics. The westerlies blow eastward at mid-latitudes. This applies a stress to the ocean surface with a curl in north and south hemispheres, causing Sverdrup transport toward the tropics.  Conservation of mass and potential vorticity cause that transport to be balanced by a narrow, intense poleward current, which flows along the western coast, allowing the vorticity introduced by coastal friction to balance the vorticity input of the wind.  The reverse effect applies to the polar gyres – the sign of the wind stress curl and the direction of the resulting currents are reversed.

Backwater (river),"A backwater is a part of a river in which there is little or no current. It can refer to a branch of a main river, which lies alongside it and then rejoins it, or to a body of water in a main river, backed up by the sea tide or by an obstruction such as a dam. Manmade restrictions to natural stream flow or temporary natural obstructions such as ice jams, vegetation blockage, or flooding of a lower stream can create backwater.

Alternative channel
If a river has developed one or more alternative courses in its evolution, one channel is usually designated the main course, and secondary channels may be termed backwaters. The main river course will usually have the fastest stream and will likely be the main navigation route; backwaters may be shallower and flow more slowly, if at all. Some backwaters are rich in mangrove forest. This results in a more diverse environment of scientific interest and worthy of preservation. Backwaters also provide opportunities for leisure activities such as canoeing and fishing. 
The term has been applied as a metaphor to physical and social areas that have been bypassed. It may apply to places that have been neglected in economic development, or in the expression a ""cultural backwater"".

Water backed up by an obstruction
When a section of a river is near the coast or another feature that sets its base level, the section influenced by the conditions at its mouth is termed a backwater. If a river flows into a lake or sea, it is the region in which the slope of the river decreases because the lower water flux permitted at the mouth causes the water to back up. Where the river outlet is strongly affected by tides, the cyclic change in base level changes the portion of the river that is a backwater. As a result, fresh and salt water may become mixed to form an estuarine environment.

Toyota Connected North America,"Toyota Connected North America is an information technology and data science company, founded in 2016 and based in Plano, Texas. Toyota Connected is a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation, founded in partnership with Microsoft, and is involved in research and the development of technology for in-vehicle services, telematics and other forms of artificial intelligence.

History
Toyota Connected North America was officially established in April 2016 in Plano, Texas, where the U.S. headquarters of Toyota Motor North America were also hosted; the company's foundation was intended as an expansion of Toyota’s partnership with Microsoft, which had originally begun in 2011 with the goal of building a platform for telematics services. As part of the venture, Microsoft had a 5 percent stake in Toyota Connected, and provided the company with access to their cloud-based platform Azure, in order to develop or expand wireless services suited to track driving patterns, share information on traffic and weather conditions and monitoring personal health data, among other functions. Toyota Connected also announced it would support research projects on artificial intelligence, while simultaneously focusing on the analysis of data from vehicle sensors and cameras to develop algorithms for self-driving cars.
At inception, Toyota invested an estimated $5.5 million in Toyota Connected; Zach Hicks, who had previously served as the chief digital officer at Toyota Motor North America, was appointed as the company’s first CEO.
In July 2022, Hicks stepped down from his role as CEO and president of Toyota Connected following his retirement, being subsequently replaced by Steve Basra. In August 2023, former Toyota Connected Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Christopher Yang was appointed as the company's new CEO, after Basra had left both the role and the company in June of the same year.
At the 2023 New York International Auto Show, Toyota Connected debuted its proprietary generative artificial intelligence tool to produce photorealistic images through text input.

Divide (drainage),"A drainage divide, water divide, ridgeline, watershed, water parting or height of land is elevated terrain that separates neighboring drainage basins. On rugged land, the divide lies along topographical ridges, and may be in the form of a single range of hills or mountains, known as a dividing range. On flat terrain, especially where the ground is marshy, the divide may be difficult to discern.
A triple divide is a point, often a summit, where three drainage basins meet. A valley floor divide is a low drainage divide that runs across a valley, sometimes created by deposition or stream capture. Major divides separating rivers that drain to different seas or oceans are continental divides.
The term height of land is used in Canada and the United States to refer to a drainage divide. It is frequently used in border descriptions, which are set according to the ""doctrine of natural boundaries"". In glaciated areas it often refers to a low point on a divide where it is possible to portage a canoe from one river system to another.

Types
Drainage divides can be divided into three types:

Continental divides in which waters on each side flow to different oceans, such as the Continental Divide of the Americas and the Congo-Nile Divide.
Major drainage divides in which waters on each side of the divide never meet but flow into the same ocean, such as the divide between the Yellow River basin and the Yangtze. Another, more subtle example is the Schuylkill-Lehigh divide at Pisgah Mountain in Pennsylvania in which two minor creeks divide to flow and grow east and west respectively joining the Lehigh River and Delaware River or the Susquehanna River and Potomac River, with each tributary complex having separate outlets into the Atlantic.
Minor drainage divides in which waters are originally separate but eventually join at a river confluence, such as the Mississippi River and the Missouri River drainage divides.

Valley-floor divides
A valley-floor divide occurs on the bottom of a valley and arises as a result of subsequent depositions, such as scree, in a valley through which a river originally flowed continuously.
Examples include the Kartitsch Saddle in the Gail valley in East Tyrol, which forms the watershed between the Drau and the Gail, and the divides in the Toblacher Feld between Innichen and Toblach in Italy, where the Drau empties into the Black Sea and the Rienz into the Adriatic.
Settlements are often built on valley-floor divides in the Alps. Examples are Eben im Pongau, Kirchberg in Tirol and Waidring (In all of these, the village name indicates the pass and the watershed is even explicitly displayed in the coat of arms). Extremely low divides with heights of less than two metres are found on the North German Plain within the Urstromtäler, for example, between Havel and Finow in the Eberswalde Urstromtal. In marsh deltas such as the Okavango, the largest drainage area on earth, or in large lakes areas, such as the Finnish Lakeland, it is difficult to find a meaningful definition of a watershed.
A bifurcation is where the watershed is effectively in a river bed, in a wetland, or underground. The largest watershed of this type is the bifurcation of the Orinoco in the north of South America, whose main stream empties into the Caribbean, but which also drains into the South Atlantic via the Casiquiare canal and Amazon River.

Since ridgelines are sometimes easy to see and agree about, drainage divides may form natural borders defining political boundaries, as with the Royal Proclamation of 1763 in British North America which coincided with the ridgeline of the Appalachian Mountains forming the Eastern Continental Divide that separated settled colonial lands in the east from Indian Territory to the west. Another instance of a border matching a watershed in modern times involves the western border between Labrador and Quebec, as arbitrated by the privy council in 1927.

Portages and canals
Drainage divides hinder waterway navigation. In pre-industrial times, water divides were crossed at portages. Later, canals connected adjoining drainage basins; a key problem in such canals is ensuring a sufficient water supply. Important examples are the Chicago Portage, connecting the Great Lakes and Mississippi by the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal, and the Canal des Deux Mers in France, connecting the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. The name is enshrined at the Height of Land Portage on the route from the Great Lakes in the Atlantic drainage basin to the Hudson Bay drainage basin.

Coloring book,"A coloring book (British English: colouring-in book, colouring book, or colouring page) is a type of book containing line art to which people are intended to add color using crayons, colored pencils, marker pens, paint or other artistic media. Traditional coloring books and coloring pages are printed on paper or card. Some coloring books have perforated edges so their pages can be removed from the books and used as individual sheets. Others may include a story line and so are intended to be left intact. Today, many children's coloring books feature popular characters. They are often used as promotional materials for motion pictures and television. Coloring books may also incorporate other activities such as connect the dots, mazes and other puzzles. Some also incorporate the use of stickers.

History
Paint books and coloring books emerged in the United States as part of the ""democratization of art"" process, inspired by a series of lectures by British artist Joshua Reynolds, and the works of Swiss educator Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi and his student Friedrich Fröbel. Many educators concluded that all students, regardless of background, stood to benefit from art education as a means of enhancing their conceptual understanding of the tangible, developing their cognitive abilities, and improving skills that would be useful in finding a profession, as well as for the children's spiritual edification. The McLoughlin Brothers are credited as the inventors of the coloring book, when, in the 1880s, they produced The Little Folks' Painting Book, in collaboration with Kate Greenaway. They continued to publish coloring books until the 1920s, when the McLoughlin Brothers became part of the Milton Bradley Company.
Another pioneer in the genre was Richard F. Outcault. He authored Buster's Paint Book in 1907, featuring the character of Buster Brown, which he had invented in 1902. It was published by the Stokes Company. This launched a trend to use coloring books to advertise a wide variety of products, including coffee and pianos. Until the 1930s, books were designed with the intent for them to be painted instead of colored. Even when crayons came into wide use in the 1930s, books were still designed so that they could be painted or colored.

Educational uses
Coloring books are widely used in schooling for young children for various reasons. For example, children are often more interested in coloring books rather than using other learning methods; pictures may also be more memorable than simply words. Coloring may also increase creativity in painting, according to some research.
As a predominantly non-verbal medium, coloring books have also seen wide applications in education where a target group does not speak and understand the primary language of instruction or communication. Examples of this include the use of coloring books in Guatemala to teach children about hieroglyphs and Mayan artist patterns, and the production of coloring books to educate the children of farm workers about ""the pathway by which agricultural pesticides are transferred from work to home."" Coloring books are also said to help to motivate students' understanding of concepts that they would otherwise be uninterested in.
They have been used as teaching aids for developing creativity and knowledge of geometry, such as in Roger Burrows' Altair Designs.
Since the 1980s, several publishers have produced educational coloring books intended for studying graduate-level topics such as anatomy and physiology, where color-coding of many detailed diagrams are used as a learning aid. Examples include The Anatomy Coloring Book and subsequent book series, by Wynn Kapit and Lawrence Elson, published by HarperCollins (1990s) and Benjamin Cummings (2000s). There are some examples of educators using coloring books to better explain complicated topics, like programming.
Some publishers have specialized in coloring books with an explicit educational purpose, both for children and for adults. The books often have extensive text accompanying each image. These publishers include Dover Books, Really Big Coloring Books, Running Press, and Troubador Press.

Health and therapeutic uses
Coloring books have seen wide application in the health professions as educational tools. One nurse, trying to limit the trauma of surgery, described in an academic publication how the use of a coloring book ""might help [the child] to understand what was going to happen to him."" They are also used in rehabilitation of accident victims to aid recovery of hand–eye coordination, and they are used with autistic children both for entertainment and for their soothing effect. Coloring books have been used to explain complicated medical conditions to children. One of the appeals of adult coloring books is that they help users relax and de-stress.

Polar desert,"Polar deserts are the regions of Earth that fall under an ice cap climate (EF under the Köppen classification). Despite rainfall totals low enough to normally classify as a desert, polar deserts are distinguished from true deserts (BWh or BWk under the Köppen classification) by low annual temperatures and evapotranspiration. Most polar deserts are covered in ice sheets, ice fields, or ice caps, and they are also called white deserts.
Polar deserts are one of two polar biomes, the other being Arctic tundra. These biomes are located at the poles of Earth, covering much of the Antarctic in the southern hemisphere, and in the northern hemisphere extending from the Arctic into North America, Europe and Asia. Unlike the tundra that can support plant and animal life in the summer, polar deserts are largely barren environments, comprising permanent, flat layers of ice; due to the scarcity of liquid water, the same is also true of the few ice-free areas. However, there is evidence of some life in this seemingly inhospitable landscape: sediments of organic and inorganic substances in the thick ice hosting microbial organisms closely related to cyanobacteria, able to fix carbon dioxide from the melting water.
Temperature changes in polar deserts frequently cross the freezing point of water. This ""freeze-thaw"" alternation forms patterned textures on the ground, as much as 5 m (16 ft) in diameter.
Most of the interior of Antarctica is polar desert, despite the thick ice cover. Conversely, the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica, although they have had no ice for thousands of years due to katabatic wind but contain ephemeral streams and hypersaline lakes characteristic of extreme non-polar deserts, are not necessarily polar desert.
Polar deserts are relatively common during ice ages, as ice ages tend to be dry.

Climate scientists have voiced concerns about the effects of global warming to the ice poles in these polar biomes.

Nici Island,"Nici Island is an island in the Philippines situated 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) from the main town of Culion in the central part of the Calamian Islands in the province of Palawan in the Philippines. The Calamian Islands are known for their many natural attractions, being a popular attraction for tourists and cruise lines.
The island has a house on top of the hill and is near the location of a SpongeBob SquarePants-themed underwater resort that was planned to be built by Nickelodeon. The project was eventually cancelled due to environmental concerns.

Popular history,"Popular history, also called pop history, is a broad genre of historiography that takes a popular approach, aims at a wide readership, and usually emphasizes narrative, personality and vivid detail over scholarly analysis. The term is used in contradistinction to professional academic or scholarly history writing which is usually more specialized and technical and thus less accessible to the general reader.

Conceptualizations
It is proposed that popular history is a ""moral science"" in the sense that recreates the past not only for its own sake but also to underscore how history could facilitate an ethically responsible present. Some view it as history produced by authors who are better interlocutors capable of translating the language of scientificity to ordinary everyday language.
Some scholars partly attributed the development of popular history to the increase of writers-turned-historians such as Benson Lossing, David Pae, and Mary Botham Howitt, who wrote historical events ""in good style"" and, thus, more appealing to the public.

Popular historians
Some popular historians are without academic affiliation while others are academics, or former academics, who have (according to one writer) ""become somehow abstracted from the academic arena, becoming cultural commentators."" Many worked as journalists, perhaps after taking an initial degree in history. Popular historians may become nationally renowned or best-selling authors and may or may not serve the interests of particular political viewpoints in their roles as historians that write for a wide-ranging readership. Many authors of supposed official histories and authorized biographies would qualify as popular historians serving the interests of particular institutions or public figures.
Popular historians aim to appear on the ""general lists"" of general publishers, rather than the university presses that have dominated academic publishing in recent years. Increasingly, popular historians have taken to television where they are able, often accompanying a series of documentaries with a tie-in book.

Examples
Academics
Recent examples of American popular historians with academic affiliations include Daniel J. Boorstin, Stephen E. Ambrose, Doris Kearns Goodwin and Pauline Maier. 
Recent examples of British popular historians who are also academics include Niall Ferguson, Mary Beard, Christopher Hibbert, David Starkey, Dan Jones, Simon Sebag Montefiore and Simon Schama, and – from a previous generation – Eric Hobsbawm, Paul Johnson, E. P. Thompson, A. J. P. Taylor (a pioneer of history on television) and Christopher Hill. Podcaster and pop history author Tom Holland, while not holding any formal qualifications in the field, does retain an academic affiliation. Much of Hugh Trevor-Roper's output was also directed at a popular audience. There is also Stella Tillyard and her work Aristocrats, which combined scholarly research with the popular method of presentation.
Canadian academics whose work has crossed over to public consciousness are few.  Examples might include Michael Bliss, Donald Creighton, Desmond Morton, J. L. Granatstein, or Margaret MacMillan.  In French Canada the influence of Father Lionel Groulx in the historical thought of the twentieth century was preponderant.

Non academics
American non-academics include Walter Lord, Bruce Catton, Shelby Foote, David McCullough, Max Cutler, Ron Cutler, and Barbara W. Tuchman. Podcasting has become a new medium for the dissemination of popular history, in which the contributions of Americans Dan Carlin and Robert Evans are notable.
John Julius Norwich, Charles Allen, and Tariq Ali are popular British historians who have never been academics.
English-Canadian writers of popular histories include journalists Pierre Berton and Peter C. Newman, humourist Will Ferguson, folklorist and pulp fiction writer Thomas P. Kelley, and television presenter Patrick Watson.  François-Xavier Garneau was the leading historian in nineteenth century French Canada from outside the academy.  Polemicists in the national unity debate have also written influentially about Canadian history, notably militant Pierre Vallières and journalist Normand Lester critiquing the Canadian state and novelist Mordecai Richler critiquing Quebec nationalist historians as anti-Semitic.  Notably, Canada has produced several writers who have written popular histories of specific ethnic communities, including Ken McGoogan (Scots and Irish), Myrna Kostash (Ukrainians), etc.

Interlingue literature,"Interlingue literature broadly encompasses the body of fiction and nonfiction work created or translated into Interlingue, a constructed language created by Edgar de Wahl. Although largely composed of original short stories and translations published in the central magazine of the language, Cosmoglotta, full length novels and poetry anthologies also exist, in particular those by authors such as Vicente Costalago, Jan Amos Kajš, and Jaroslav Podobský.

History
Background
Interlingue, also known as Occidental, is an international auxiliary language created in 1922 by Estonian teacher Edgar de Wahl. It has a largely Western European vocabulary, based largely on the Romance languages, with heavy influence from English. Created in 1922, it was first published in the magazine Kosmoglott (later Cosmoglotta), where it built a following. Due to a lack of published grammars and standardisation, the earliest works in the language used non-standard orthography and grammatical structures.

Publications
The first known publication in Interlingue is the book Transcendent algebra, mathematical ideography, experiment of a philosophical language (Interlingue: Transcendent algebra, ideografie matematical, experiment de un lingue filosofic) by Estonian linguist Jakob Linzbach, a proposal for a pasigraphy. This was translated into Interlingue by de Wahl at Linzbach's request. This was published before de Wahl formalised the language in Kosmoglott, while the language was still in its development, as a proto-language named ""Auli"".
The first work of Interlingue literature as art was by Kaarle Julius Saarinen: a translation of the poem ""Hymn"" (""Hymne"") by Finnish journalist and writer Kaarlo Hammar, appeared in the 1925 edition of Kosmoglott. Several other translations of foreign literature were also published by A. Toman around this time, such as the Wanderer's Nightsong poems by Goethe in the 1926 supplement to Kosmoglott, and a translation of ""Nationalism in the West"" by Rabindranath Tagore.
In Supplement al Cosmoglotta 7 (1927), a translation of work by Persian poet Saadi Shirazi was presented, alongside work by Hermann Keyserling in the following edition in 1927.
A series of translations were published in the 1930s, including Konstantin Balmont's Where is my home?, Manuel Menendez by Edmondo De Amicis, and A Descent into the Maelström by Edgar Allan Poe. Additionally, several original works were published, such as a poetry anthology, Li Astres del Verne (The Planets of Spring), by Podobský, Krasina, raconta del subterrania del Moravian carst by Kajš, and several works by A. E. Cortinas and P. Dimitriev. A short story collection, Historiettes in Occidental, was published in 1930 by Ric Berger.

In 1951, with the creation of Interlingua, many occidentalists, including Berger, one of the most important figures of the Interlingue movement, began to support this new IALA language. This led to a large destabilisation of the movement, and while Cosmoglotta continued to be published, it did so with diminishing frequency, ceasing publication in 1985. According to Esperantist author Don Harlow, the editor of Cosmoglotta in this period, Adrian Pilgrim stated that Interlingue could be described as a ""dead language"".
However, publications of new literature in Interlingue continued throughout the 1950s and the early 1960s, with translations including ""A Mother Speaks"" by Czech Jiří Marek in 1954, Multatuli's ""The alocution to the bosses of Lebak"", and ""Wedding Shirt"" by Karel Jaromír Erben, translated by Josef Křesina.
Other translated books included Arvid Brenner's Un Adío (A Farewell) and Bo Bergman's A Desertor by Eric Ahlström in 1958. In 1964, Francis R. Pope published Poemas (Poems), an anthology consisting of poems translated from German, French, and English.
The revival of Interlingue began in 1999 with the creation of a Yahoo! group for the language, after a decade of decay in the 1980s and 1990s. In the early 2000s, Interlingue Wikipedia was created, which had over 5000 articles in 2020.
Many original Interlingue texts as well as translations have been published since 2000, with the first being Stendhal's The Charterhouse of Parma (Li Cartusie de Parma), translated by Robert Winter in 2011. In 2012, Thomas Schmidt published Li Munde de Sandra in an online magazine, Posta Mundi, which contains material published in constructed languages. This was followed with a translation of The Little Prince in 2014 and another one of Li Romance de Photogen e Nycteris in 2019.
Between 2021 and 2023 Vicente Costalago published several original and translated texts in Interlingue. Among the firsts are Li sercha in li castelle Dewahl e altri racontas, Li tresor de Fluvglant, Subuqti e Verses escapat de mi mente. Among the latter we can find Antologie hispan, Fabules, racontas e mites, and Antologie de poesie europan.

Political capitalism,"Political capitalism or Politically oriented capitalism is a concept introduced by Max Weber in his 1921 book Economy and Society to describe monetary profit-making through non-market means. In 2018, Holcombe describes political capitalism as an economic system in which the sharp distinction between states and markets is blurred.
Robert Brenner and Dylan Riley have characterized the post-1990 economy of United States as political capitalism, where raw 'political power' rather than 'productive investment' is the ""key determinant of rate of return"".

Background
The definition of capitalism as an economic system based on monetary profit-making rather than a subsistence economy is shared by Max Weber and Fernand Braudel.

Paleolimnology,"Paleolimnology (from Greek: παλαιός, palaios, ""ancient"", λίμνη, limne, ""lake"", and λόγος, logos, ""study"") is a scientific sub-discipline closely related to both limnology and paleoecology. Paleolimnological studies focus on reconstructing the past environments of inland waters (e.g., lakes and streams) using the geologic record, especially with regard to events such as climatic change, eutrophication, acidification, and internal ontogenic processes.
Paleolimnological studies are mostly conducted using analyses of the physical, chemical, and mineralogical properties of sediments, or of biological records such as fossil pollen, diatoms, or chironomids.

History
Lake ontogeny
Most early paleolimnological studies focused on the biological productivity of lakes, and the role of internal lake processes in lake development. Although Einar Naumann had speculated that the productivity of lakes should gradually decrease due to leaching of catchment soils, August Thienemann suggested that the reverse process likely occurred. Early midge records seemed to support Thienemann's view.
Hutchinson and Wollack suggested that, following an initial oligotrophic stage, lakes would achieve and maintain a trophic equilibrium. They also stressed parallels between the early development of lake communities and the sigmoid growth phase of animal communities – implying that the apparent early developmental processes in lakes were dominated by colonization effects, and lags due to the limited reproductive potential of the colonizing organisms.
In a classic paper, Raymond Lindeman outlined a hypothetical developmental sequence, with lakes progressively developing through oligotrophic, mesotrophic, and eutrophic stages, before senescing to a dystrophic stage and then filling completely with sediment. A climax forest community would eventually be established on the peaty fill of the former lake basin. These ideas were further elaborated by Ed Deevey, who suggested that lake development was dominated by a process of morphometric eutrophication. As the hypolimnion of lakes gradually filled with sediments, oxygen depletion would promote the release of iron-bound phosphorus to the overlying water. This process of internal fertilization would stimulate biological productivity, further accelerating the in-filling process.
Deevey and Lindemann's ideas were widely accepted. Although these ideas are still widely held by some limnologists, they were refuted in 1957 by Deevey's student Daniel A. Livingstone. Mel Whiteside also criticized Deevey and Lindemann's hypothesis; and paleolimnologists now think that a host of external factors are equally or more important as regulators of lake development and productivity. Indeed, late-glacial climatic oscillations (e.g., the Younger Dryas) appear to have been accompanied by parallel changes in productivity, which shows that lake development is not a unidirectional process, and climatic change can have a profound effect on lake communities.

Anthropogenic eutrophication, acidification, and climate change
Interest in paleolimnology eventually shifted from esoteric questions of lake ontogeny to applied investigations of human impact. Torgny Wiederholm and Bill Warwick, for example, used chironomid fossils to assess the impact of increased, human-caused nutrient loading (anthropogenic eutrophication) on lake communities. Their studies revealed pronounced changes in the bottom fauna of North American and European lakes as a consequence of severe oxygen depletion.
From 1980 to 1990 the primary focus of paleolimnologists' efforts shifted to understanding the impact human activity had (e.g., acid rain) versus natural processes (e.g., soil leaching) as drivers of pH change in northern lakes. The pH-sensitivity of diatom communities had been recognized as early as the 1930s, when Friedrich Hustedt developed a classification for diatoms, based on their apparent pH preferences. Gunnar Nygaard subsequently developed a series of diatom pH indices. By calibrating these indices to pH, Jouko Meriläinen introduced the first diatom-pH transfer function. Using diatom and chrysophyte fossil records, research groups were able to clearly demonstrate that many northern lakes had rapidly acidified in consequence of increased industrialization. Although lakes also showed a tendency to acidify slightly during their early (late-glacial) history, the pH of most lakes had remained stable for several thousand years prior to their recent human-driven acidification.
In recent years paleolimnologists have recognized that climate is a dominant force in aquatic ecosystem processes, and have begun to use lacustrine records to reconstruct paleoclimates. Detailed records of historical climate change have been developed from a variety of indicators, including, for example, paleotemperature reconstructions derived from chironomid fossils, and paleosalinity records inferred from diatoms.

Calconcarboxylic acid,"Calconcarboxylic acid (IUPAC name 3-hydroxy-4-[(2-hydroxy-4-sulfonaphthalen-1-yl)diazenyl]naphthalene-2-carboxylic acid; commonly called Patton and Reeder's Indicator) is an azo dye that is used as an indicator for complexometric titrations of calcium with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in the presence of magnesium. Structurally, it is similar to eriochrome blue black R, which is obtained from calconcarboxylic acid  by decarboxylation and reaction with sodium hydroxide.

Properties
Calconcarboxlic acid is soluble in water and a variety of other solvents, including sodium hydroxide, ethanol and methanol. It has a violet colour in dissolved form in ethanol. The melting point of calconcarboxylic acid is at approximately 300 °C, where it undergoes thermal decomposition.

Background
Though the determination of calcium and magnesium by complexometric titration with standard solutions of disodium dihydrogen tetraacetate, utilising Eriochrome Black T as indicator is widely accepted and quite adequately understood, it, like other complexometric titration methods, suffers from the limitations of having an indistinct endpoint (where a photometric titrator is needed to provide acceptable accuracy) and/or having to separate the metals before titration can occur. Calconcarboxylic acid was thus adopted as a superior alternative due to its ability to give a good and visual endpoint and its rapid performance even with the presence of magnesium.

Synthesis
As described by James Patton and Wendell Reeder in 1956, calconcarboxylic acid can be synthesised by coupling diazotized 1-amino-2-naphthol-4-sulfonic acid with 2-hydroxy-3-napthoic acid.

Applications
Calconcarboxylic acid is used for the determination of calcium ion concentration by complexometric titration. Free calconcarboxylic acid is blue colour, but changes to pink/red when it forms a complex with calcium ions. EDTA forms a more stable complex with calcium than calconcarboxylic acid does, so addition of EDTA to the Ca–calconcarboxylic acid complex causes formation of Ca-EDTA instead, leading to reversion to the blue colour of free calconcarboxylic acid.
For the complexometric titration, the indicator is first added to the titrant containing the calcium ions to form the calcium ion-indicator complex (Ca-PR) with a pink/red colour. This is then titrated against a standard solution of EDTA. The endpoint can be observed when the indicator produces a sharp, stable colour change from wine red to pure blue, which occurs at pH values between 12 and 14, this indicates the endpoint of the titration, as the Ca-PR complexes have been completely replaced by the Ca-EDTA complexes and hence the PR indicator reverts to its blue colour.
The reaction can be given by:

Ca-PR + EDTA4- → PR + [Ca-EDTA]2-
The Patton-Reeder Indicator is often used here in the form of a triturate.
This method of complexometric titration is dependent on the pH of the solution being sufficiently high to ensure that magnesium ions precipitate as magnesium hydroxide before the PR indicator is added to prevent interference with the results, as if magnesium were present, the EDTA would also form complexes with it. Concentrated sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide is usually added to the solution to this end.
The accuracy of this method may also be affected by the presence of metal ions such as copper, iron, cobalt, zinc or manganese in sufficiently high concentrations.

C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group,"C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group is a group of 96 cities that represents one twelfth of the world's population and one quarter of the global economy. Created and led by cities, C40 is focused on fighting the climate crisis and driving urban action that reduces greenhouse gas emissions and climate risks, while increasing the health, wellbeing and economic opportunities of urban residents.
From 2023, Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan and Mayor of Freetown, Yvonne Aki-Sawyerr serve as C40's Co-Chair, former mayor of New York City Michael Bloomberg as Board President, and Mark Watts as Executive Director. All four work closely with the 13-member steering committee, the Board of Directors and professional staff. The rotating steering committee of C40 mayors provides strategic direction and governance. Steering committee members include: London, Freetown, Phoenix, Medellin, Copenhagen, Paris, Dhaka North, Nairobi, Tokyo, Rio de Janeiro, Montreal, Milan, Seoul, Oslo and Hong Kong.
Working across multiple sectors and initiative areas, C40 convenes networks of cities providing a suite of services in support of their efforts, including: direct technical assistance; facilitation of peer-to-peer exchange; and research, knowledge management & communications. C40 is also positioning cities as a leading force for climate action around the world, defining and amplifying their call to national governments for greater support and autonomy in creating a sustainable future.

History
C40 started in October 2005 when London Mayor Ken Livingstone convened representatives from 18 megacities to forge an agreement on cooperatively reducing climate pollution and created the 'C20'. In 2006, Mayor Livingstone and the Clinton Climate Initiative (CCI)—led by the efforts of former U.S. President Bill Clinton—combined to strengthen both organizations, bringing the number of cities in the network to 40 and helping to deliver projects and project management for participating cities to further enhance emissions reductions efforts.
Serving as C40's first chair, Livingstone established the C40 Secretariat in London, set up the C40 Steering Committee, and initiated the use of C40 workshops to exchange best practices amongst participating cities. In 2008, former mayor of Toronto David Miller took over as C40 chair. Highlights of his tenure included the Copenhagen Climate Summit for Mayors and the C40 Cities Mayors Summit in Seoul, both in 2009, as well as the launch of practical action initiatives for cities, such as the Climate Positive Development Program and the Carbon Finance Capacity Building program.
Three-term Mayor of New York City Michael Bloomberg served as chair from 2010 to 2013. During his three-year tenure, Mayor Bloomberg demonstrated unwavering commitment to building a professional organization and establishing measurable and uniform benchmarks for success, as well as expanding knowledge-sharing between cities and partner organizations with similar priorities. Key milestones during his chairmanship include the full integration of the CCI Cities Program into the C40, and the C40 Mayors Summits in São Paulo and Johannesburg. Under Mayor Bloomberg's leadership, C40 grew to include 63 cities.
In December 2013 former mayor of Rio de Janeiro Eduardo Paes became Chair of C40. During his tenure Mayor Paes oversaw the addition of more than 20 new member cities (particularly those in the Global South) several groundbreaking research reports, successful international events, and thriving global partnerships, all of which are helping cities make real contributions to the reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions and climate risks. He also helped launch the Compact of Mayors (now the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy), put in place the C40 Cities Finance Facility, and oversaw the opening of a permanent C40 office in Rio de Janeiro, at the Museum of Tomorrow.
In 2015, as C40 marked its 10th anniversary, cities were crucial voices in shaping and advocating for a strong Paris Agreement—just as city leaders will be crucial in delivering on its ambition going forward. More than 1,000 mayors, local representatives, and community leaders from around the world took part in the Climate Summit for Local Leaders, hosted by Mayor of Paris Anne Hidalgo and the UN Secretary-General's Special Envoy for Cities and Climate Change Michael R. Bloomberg during the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference.
In August 2016, Mayor of Paris Anne Hidalgo became C40's first chairwoman after being voted in unanimously by the Steering Committee. Mayor Hidalgo has announced an ambitious agenda for the organization, including plans to focus on securing green financing, supporting compliance with the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy, encouraging inclusive and sustainable growth in cities, and recognizing the leadership of women in tackling climate change.
In December 2016, C40 held its sixth biennial Mayors Summit in Mexico City.

Crevasse splay,"A crevasse splay is a sedimentary fluvial deposit which forms when a stream breaks its natural or artificial levees and deposits sediment on a floodplain. A breach that forms a crevasse splay deposits sediments in similar pattern to an alluvial fan deposit. Once the levee has been breached the water flows out of its channel. As the water spreads onto the flood plain sediments will start to fall out of suspension as the water loses energy. The resulting deposition can create graded deposits similar to those found in Bouma sequences. In some cases crevasse splays can cause a river to abandon its old river channel, a process known as avulsion. Breaches that form a crevasse splay deposits occur most commonly on the outside banks of meanders where the water has the highest energy. Crevasse splay deposits can range in size. Larger deposits can be 6 m (20 ft) thick at the levee and spread 2 km (1.2 mi) wide, while smaller deposits may only be 1 cm (0.39 in) thick.

Governmentality,"Governmentality is a concept first developed by the French philosopher Michel Foucault, roughly between 1977 and his death in 1984, particularly in his lectures at the Collège de France during this time.
Variously, governmentality can be understood as:

the organized practices (mentalities, rationalities, and techniques) through which subjects are governed
the ""art of government""
the ""how"" of governing (that is, the calculated means of directing how we behave and act)
""governmental rationality""
""a 'guideline' for the analysis that Michel Foucault offers by way of historical reconstructions embracing a period starting from Ancient Greece right through to modernity and neo-liberalism""
""the techniques and strategies by which a society is rendered governable""
The ""reasoned way of governing best and, at the same time, reflection on the best possible way of governing""
Peter Miller, Nikolas Rose and Mitchell Dean, among other scholars, have elaborated on the notion of governmentality.

Etymology
This term was thought by some commentators to be made by the ""...linking of governing (""gouverner"") and modes of thought (""mentalité"")"".

In fact, it was not coined by uniting words ""gouvernement"" and ""mentalité"", but simply by making gouvernement into gouvernementalité just like musical into musicalité [i.e. government + -al- adjective + -ité abstract noun] (see Michel Senellart's ""Course Context"" in Foucault's ""Security, territory, population"" lectures). To fully understand this concept, it is important to realize that in this case, Foucault does not only use the standard, strictly political definition of ""governing"" or government used today, but he also uses the broader definition of governing or government that was employed until the eighteenth century. That is to say, that in this case, for Foucault, ""...'government' also signified problems of self-control, guidance for the family and for children, management of the household, directing the soul, etc."" In other words, for our purposes, government is ""...the conduct of conduct...""

Basic definition
In his lectures at the Collège de France, Foucault often defines governmentality as the ""art of government"" in a wide sense, i.e. with an idea of ""government"" that is not limited to state politics alone, that includes a wide range of control techniques, and that applies to a wide variety of objects, from one's control of the self to the ""biopolitical"" control of populations. In the work of Foucault, this notion is indeed linked to other concepts such as biopolitics and power-knowledge. The genealogical exploration of the modern state as ""problem of government"" does not only deepen Foucault's analyses on sovereignty and biopolitics; it offers an analytics of government which refines both Foucault's theory of power and his understanding of freedom.
The concept of ""governmentality"" develops a new understanding of power. Foucault encourages us to think of power not only in terms of hierarchical, top-down power of the state. He widens our understanding of power to also include the forms of social control in disciplinary institutions (schools, hospitals, psychiatric institutions, etc.), as well as the forms of knowledge. Power can manifest itself positively by producing knowledge and certain discourses that get internalised by individuals and guide the behaviour of populations. This leads to more efficient forms of social control, as knowledge enables individuals to govern themselves.
""Governmentality"" applies to a variety of historical periods and to different specific power regimes. However, it is often used (by other scholars and by Foucault himself) in reference to ""neoliberal governmentality"", i.e. to a type of governmentality that characterizes advanced liberal democracies. In this case, the notion of governmentality refers to societies where power is de-centered and its members play an active role in their own self-government, e.g. as posited in neoliberalism. Because of their active role, individuals need to be regulated from 'inside'. A particular form of governmentality is characterized by a certain form of knowledge (""savoir"" in French). In the case of neoliberal governmentality (a kind of governmentality based on the predominance of market mechanisms and of the restriction of the action of the state) the knowledge produced allows the construction of auto-regulated or auto-correcting selves.
In his lecture titled Governmentality, Foucault gives us a definition of governmentality:

""1. The ensemble formed by the institutions, procedures, analyses and reflections, the calculations and tactics that allow the exercise of this very specific albeit complex form of power, which has as its target: population, as its principal form of knowledge: political economy, and as its essential technical means: apparatuses of security.
2. The tendency which, over a long period and throughout the West, has steadily led towards the pre-eminence over all other forms (sovereignty, discipline,",Geography,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governmentality,1,governmentality concept first developed french philosopher michel foucault roughly death particularly lecture collège de france time variously governmentality understood organized practice mentality rationality technique subject governed art government governing calculated mean directing behave act governmental rationality guideline analysis michel foucault offer way historical reconstruction embracing period starting ancient greece right modernity neoliberalism technique strategy society rendered governable reasoned way governing best time reflection best possible way governing peter miller nikolas rose mitchell dean among scholar elaborated notion governmentality etymology term thought commentator made linking governing gouverner mode thought mentalité fact coined uniting word gouvernement mentalité simply making gouvernement gouvernementalité like musical musicalité ie government al adjective ité abstract noun see michel senellarts course context foucault security territory population lecture fully understand concept important realize case foucault use standard strictly political definition governing government used today also us broader definition governing government employed eighteenth century say case foucault government also signified problem selfcontrol guidance family child management household directing soul etc word purpose government conduct conduct basic definition lecture collège de france foucault often defines governmentality art government wide sense ie idea government limited state politics alone includes wide range control technique applies wide variety object one control self biopolitical control population work foucault notion indeed linked concept biopolitics powerknowledge genealogical exploration modern state problem government deepen foucault analysis sovereignty biopolitics offer analytics government refines foucault theory power understanding freedom concept governmentality develops new understanding power foucault encourages u think power term hierarchical topdown power state widens understanding power also include form social control disciplinary institution school hospital psychiatric institution etc well form knowledge power manifest positively producing knowledge certain discourse get internalised individual guide behaviour population lead efficient form social control knowledge enables individual govern governmentality applies variety historical period different specific power regime however often used scholar foucault reference neoliberal governmentality ie type governmentality characterizes advanced liberal democracy case notion governmentality refers society power decentered member play active role selfgovernment eg posited neoliberalism active role individual need regulated inside particular form governmentality characterized certain form knowledge savoir french case neoliberal governmentality kind governmentality based predominance market mechanism restriction action state knowledge produced allows construction autoregulated autocorrecting self lecture titled governmentality foucault give u definition governmentality ensemble formed institution procedure analysis reflection calculation tactic allow exercise specific albeit complex form power target population principal form knowledge political economy essential technical mean apparatus security tendency long period throughout west steadily led towards preeminence form sovereignty discipline
Ocean development,"Ocean development refers to the establishing of human activities at sea and use of the ocean, as well as its governance.

Politics
Ocean development has been a central regulatory issue of the law of the sea. Particularly in regard of marine conservation, ocean development has been critically analyzed as engulfed in colonialist logic, broadening contemporarily regulatory discussion and measures.
The main international bodies of ocean governance are the International Maritime Organization, International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea and International Seabed Authority of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.

India
There was a Ministry of Ocean Development in the Government of India, until 2006 when it became part of a larger Ministry of Earth Sciences.

Atlantic Ocean,"The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's five oceanic divisions, with an area of about 85,133,000 km2 (32,870,000 sq mi). It covers approximately 17% of Earth's surface and about 24% of its water surface area. During the Age of Discovery, it was known for separating the New World of the Americas (North America and South America) from the Old World of Afro-Eurasia (Africa, Asia, and Europe).
Through its separation of Afro-Eurasia from the Americas, the Atlantic Ocean has played a central role in the development of human society, globalization, and the histories of many nations. While the Norse were the first known humans to cross the Atlantic, it was the expedition of Christopher Columbus in 1492 that proved to be the most consequential. Columbus's expedition ushered in an age of exploration and colonization of the Americas by European powers, most notably Portugal, Spain, France, and the United Kingdom. From the 16th to 19th centuries, the Atlantic Ocean was the center of both an eponymous slave trade and the Columbian exchange while occasionally hosting naval battles. Such naval battles, as well as growing trade from regional American powers like the United States and Brazil, both increased in degree during the early 20th century, and while no major military conflicts have taken place in the Atlantic recently, the ocean remains a core component of trade around the world.
The Atlantic Ocean occupies an elongated, S-shaped basin extending longitudinally between Europe and Africa to the east, and the Americas to the west. As one component of the interconnected World Ocean, it is connected in the north to the Arctic Ocean, to the Pacific Ocean in the southwest, the Indian Ocean in the southeast, and the Southern Ocean in the south. Other definitions describe the Atlantic as extending southward to Antarctica. The Atlantic Ocean is divided in two parts, the northern and southern Atlantic, by the Equator.

Toponymy
The oldest known mentions of an ""Atlantic"" sea come from Stesichorus around mid-sixth century BC (Sch. A. R. 1. 211): Atlantikôi pelágei (Ancient Greek: Ἀτλαντικῷ πελάγει, 'the Atlantic sea', etym. 'Sea of Atlas') and in The Histories of Herodotus around 450 BC (Hdt. 1.202.4): Atlantis thalassa (Ancient Greek: Ἀτλαντὶς θάλασσα, 'Sea of Atlas' or 'the Atlantic sea') where the name refers to ""the sea beyond the pillars of Hercules"" which is said to be part of the sea that surrounds all land. In these uses, the name refers to Atlas, the Titan in Greek mythology, who supported the heavens and who later appeared as a frontispiece in medieval maps and also lent his name to modern atlases. On the other hand, to early Greek sailors and in ancient Greek mythological literature such as the Iliad and the Odyssey, this all-encompassing ocean was instead known as Oceanus, the gigantic river that encircled the world; in contrast to the enclosed seas well known to the Greeks: the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. In contrast, the term ""Atlantic"" originally referred specifically to the Atlas Mountains in Morocco and the sea off the Strait of Gibraltar and the West African coast.
The term ""Aethiopian Ocean"", derived from Ancient Ethiopia, was applied to the southern Atlantic as late as the mid-19th century. During the Age of Discovery, the Atlantic was also known to English cartographers as the Great Western Ocean.

The pond is a term often used by British and American speakers in reference to the northern Atlantic Ocean, as a form of meiosis, or ironic understatement. It is used mostly when referring to events or circumstances ""on this side of the pond"" or ""on the other side of the pond"" or ""across the pond"", rather than to discuss the ocean itself. The term dates to 1640, first appearing in print in a pamphlet released during the reign of Charles I, and reproduced in 1869 in Nehemiah Wallington's Historical Notices of Events Occurring Chiefly in The Reign of Charles I, where ""great Pond"" is used in reference to the Atlantic Ocean by Francis Windebank, Charles I's Secretary of State.

Extent and data
The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) defined the limits of the oceans and seas in 1953, but some of these definitions have been revised since then and some are not recognized by various authorities, institutions, and countries, for example the CIA World Factbook. Correspondingly, the extent and number of oceans and seas vary.
The Atlantic Ocean is bounded on the west by North and South America. It connects to the Arctic Ocean through the Labrador Sea, Denmark Strait, Greenland Sea, Norwegian Sea and Barents Sea with the northern divider passing through Iceland and Svalbard. To the east, the boundaries of the ocean proper are Europe and Africa: the Strait of Gibraltar (where it connects with the Mediterranean Sea – one of its marginal seas – and, in turn, the Black Sea, both of which also touch upon Asia).
In the southeast, the Atlantic merges into the Indian Ocean.

Mountain,"A mountain is an elevated portion of the Earth's crust, generally with steep sides that show significant exposed bedrock. Although definitions vary, a mountain may differ from a plateau in having a limited summit area, and is usually higher than a hill, typically rising at least 300 metres (980 ft) above the surrounding land. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in mountain ranges.
Mountains are formed through tectonic forces, erosion, or volcanism, which act on time scales of up to tens of millions of years. Once mountain building ceases, mountains are slowly leveled through the action of weathering, through slumping and other forms of mass wasting, as well as through erosion by rivers and glaciers.
High elevations on mountains produce colder climates than at sea level at similar latitude. These colder climates strongly affect the ecosystems of mountains: different elevations have different plants and animals. Because of the less hospitable terrain and climate, mountains tend to be used less for agriculture and more for resource extraction, such as mining and logging, along with recreation, such as mountain climbing and skiing.
The highest mountain on Earth is Mount Everest in the Himalayas of Asia, whose summit is 8,850 m (29,035 ft) above mean sea level. The highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System is Olympus Mons on Mars at 21,171 m (69,459 ft). The tallest mountain including submarine terrain is Mauna Kea in Hawaii from its underwater base at 9,330 m (30,610 ft);  some scientists consider it to be the tallest on earth.

Definition
There is no universally accepted definition of a mountain. Elevation, volume, relief, steepness, spacing and continuity have been used as criteria for defining a mountain. In the Oxford English Dictionary a mountain is defined as ""a natural elevation of the earth surface rising more or less abruptly from the surrounding level and attaining an altitude which, relatively to the adjacent elevation, is impressive or notable.""
Whether a landform is called a mountain may depend on local usage. John Whittow's Dictionary of Physical Geography states ""Some authorities regard eminences above 600 metres (1,969 ft) as mountains, those below being referred to as hills.""
In the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, a mountain is usually defined as any summit at least 2,000 feet (610 m) high, which accords with the official UK government's definition that a mountain, for the purposes of access, is a summit of 2,000 feet (610 m) or higher. In addition, some definitions also include a topographical prominence requirement, such as that the mountain rises 300 metres (984 ft) above the surrounding terrain. At one time, the United States Board on Geographic Names defined a mountain as being 1,000 feet (305 m) or taller, but has abandoned the definition since the 1970s. Any similar landform lower than this height was considered a hill. However, today, the United States Geological Survey concludes that these terms do not have technical definitions in the US.
The UN Environmental Programme's definition of ""mountainous environment"" includes any of the following:: 74 

Class 1: Elevation greater than 4,500 m (14,764 ft).
Class 2: Elevation between 3,500 and 4,500 m (11,483 and 14,764 ft).
Class 3: Elevation between 2,500 and 3,500 m (8,202 and 11,483 ft).
Class 4: Elevation between 1,500 and 2,500 m (4,921 and 8,202 ft), with a slope greater than 2 degrees.
Class 5: Elevation between 1,000 and 1,500 m (3,281 and 4,921 ft), with a slope greater than 5 degrees or 300 m (984 ft) elevation range within 7 km (4.3 mi).
Class 6: Elevation between 300 and 1,000 m (984 and 3,281 ft), with a 300 m (984 ft) elevation range within 7 km (4.3 mi).
Class 7: Isolated inner basins and plateaus less than 25 km2 (9.7 sq mi) in area that are completely surrounded by Class 1 to 6 mountains, but do not themselves meet criteria for Class 1 to 6 mountains.
Using these definitions, mountains cover 33% of Eurasia, 19% of South America, 24% of North America, and 14% of Africa.: 14  As a whole, 24% of the Earth's land mass is mountainous.

Geology
There are three main types of mountains: volcanic, fold, and block. All three types are formed from plate tectonics: when portions of the Earth's crust move, crumple, and dive. Compressional forces, isostatic uplift and intrusion of igneous matter forces surface rock upward, creating a landform higher than the surrounding features. The height of the feature makes it either a hill or, if higher and steeper, a mountain. Major mountains tend to occur in long linear arcs, indicating tectonic plate boundaries and activity.

Volcanoes
Volcanoes are formed when a plate is pushed below another plate, or at a mid-ocean ridge or hotspot. At a depth of around 100 km (60 mi), melting occurs in rock above the slab (due to the addition of water), and forms magma that reaches the surface. When the magma reaches the surface, it often builds a volcanic mountain, su",Mountains,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain,1,mountain elevated portion earth crust generally steep side show significant exposed bedrock although definition vary mountain may differ plateau limited summit area usually higher hill typically rising least metre ft surrounding land mountain isolated summit occur mountain range mountain formed tectonic force erosion volcanism act time scale ten million year mountain building cease mountain slowly leveled action weathering slumping form mass wasting well erosion river glacier high elevation mountain produce colder climate sea level similar latitude colder climate strongly affect ecosystem mountain different elevation different plant animal less hospitable terrain climate mountain tend used less agriculture resource extraction mining logging along recreation mountain climbing skiing highest mountain earth mount everest himalaya asia whose summit ft mean sea level highest known mountain planet solar system olympus mon mar ft tallest mountain including submarine terrain mauna kea hawaii underwater base ft scientist consider tallest earth definition universally accepted definition mountain elevation volume relief steepness spacing continuity used criterion defining mountain oxford english dictionary mountain defined natural elevation earth surface rising less abruptly surrounding level attaining altitude relatively adjacent elevation impressive notable whether landform called mountain may depend local usage john whittows dictionary physical geography state authority regard eminence metre ft mountain referred hill united kingdom republic ireland mountain usually defined summit least foot high accord official uk government definition mountain purpose access summit foot higher addition definition also include topographical prominence requirement mountain rise metre ft surrounding terrain one time united state board geographic name defined mountain foot taller abandoned definition since similar landform lower height considered hill however today united state geological survey concludes term technical definition u un environmental programme definition mountainous environment includes following class elevation greater ft class elevation ft class elevation ft class elevation ft slope greater degree class elevation ft slope greater degree ft elevation range within km mi class elevation ft ft elevation range within km mi class isolated inner basin plateau less km sq mi area completely surrounded class mountain meet criterion class mountain using definition mountain cover eurasia south america north america africa whole earth land mass mountainous geology three main type mountain volcanic fold block three type formed plate tectonics portion earth crust move crumple dive compressional force isostatic uplift intrusion igneous matter force surface rock upward creating landform higher surrounding feature height feature make either hill higher steeper mountain major mountain tend occur long linear arc indicating tectonic plate boundary activity volcano volcano formed plate pushed another plate midocean ridge hotspot depth around km mi melting occurs rock slab due addition water form magma reach surface magma reach surface often build volcanic mountain su
Vector measuring current meter,"A vector measuring current meter (VMCM) is an instrument used for obtaining measurements of horizontal velocity in the upper ocean, which exploits two orthogonal cosine response propeller sensors that directly measure the components of horizontal velocity.
VMCM was developed in the late 1970s by Drs. Robert Weller and Russ Davis and commercially produced by EG&G Sealink System (currently EdgeTech).
The instrument has the capability of one year long deployment at depths of up to 5000 m. Both laboratory and field test results show that the VMCM is capable of making accurate measurements of horizontal velocity in the upper ocean. The VMCM is the current standard for making high quality velocity measurements in near-surface regions  and it has been used for benchmarking other current meters.

Equipment
The main components of a VMCM are its two orthogonal cosine response propeller sensors, that directly measure the components of horizontal velocity parallel to their axes. The orientation of the instrument with respect to magnetic north is sensed with a flux-gate compass, which permits to evaluate the direction of flux, providing the angle of the Y axis with respect to the magnetic North.
A microprocessor rotates the X-Y coordinates in the conventional east–west and north–south components of velocity. This is done once each sample interval and, at the end of the record interval, the conventional components of velocity are averaged and the averages are stored on a cassette magnetic tape. Other components of the system are a bearing retainer, an end cap, an outer bearing race, a ball retainer and bearing balls, an encoder and an epoxy or Noryl plastic disk with four magnets, pressure window, an aluminum disk, two magnetodiodes mounted asymmetrically on a printed circuit ring, a hub, and a shaft with inner races machined in it. The function of the magnetodiodes is detecting the rotation of the propeller sensors.
Incorporated in the system there is the vector averaging electronics, that uses the pulses from the magnetodiodes and the instrument heading from the flux-gate compass to calculate and record the velocity components. In the 1990s, Way et al. upgraded the electronics by redesigning the vector measuring circuitry, data acquisition, and storage components and retaining instead the propeller sensors assembly, which proved to be reliable in the several tests accomplished. A pressure case houses the electronics and the appendage on which the propellers are mounted on.
In its first design of the late 1970s, a VMCM was approximately 2.56 m high and had a mass of 34.5 kg in air. The original VMCM is no longer commercially available from EG&G (currently EdgeTech). The 1970s electronics components are outdated and difficult, if not impossible, to find. Like many of the electronic components the original flux gate compass is no longer available.

Propeller sensors
The innovation brought from VMCM over other current meters results from the choice of the biaxial propeller sensors, developed with accurate cosine response, and the design of the instrument so that flow interference with the instrument body was minimized.
""Cosine response"" refers to propellers that only respond to the component of flow parallel to their axis of rotation. Their revolution rate is then proportional to the magnitude of the flow times the cosine of the angle between the axle and the flow vector.
If the angular response function of the propellers is cosinusoidal, then two such sensors at right angles with their axes in the horizontal plane measure orthogonal components of horizontal velocity directly. No computation of components is necessary (though they are rotated from the instrument reference frame into the conventional east–west and north–south components), and summing the components accomplishes the vector averaging.
The advantages of a propeller with cosine response have been widely recognized. Weller and Davis designed the propeller sensors and their location within the pressure cage in order to obtain a response as close as possible to an ideal cosinusoidal angular response. After having fabricated and testes several families of propellers, they found the best response in a dual propeller (two propellers fixed on an axle) sensor with two five-bladed, 30-degree pitch propellers with diameter of 22 cm. The propellers are hard anodized, epoxy coated on the exterior, and protected by zinc anodes. They have been made from polycarbonate plastic (LEXAN) and, more recently, from Noryl. Propeller sensors make use of Cartesian coordinate system and provide orthogonal velocity components in the horizontal plane. The measured coordinates need only be rotated in the conventional directions east–west and north–south.

The pressure case houses the electronics and the appendage on which the propellers are mounted on. It is fabricated from 6A1-4V titanium alloy rod (1.27 cm diameter), which withstand higher yield strength than steel and has ",Oceans,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_measuring_current_meter,1,vector measuring current meter vmcm instrument used obtaining measurement horizontal velocity upper ocean exploit two orthogonal cosine response propeller sensor directly measure component horizontal velocity vmcm developed late drs robert weller rus davis commercially produced egg sealink system currently edgetech instrument capability one year long deployment depth laboratory field test result show vmcm capable making accurate measurement horizontal velocity upper ocean vmcm current standard making high quality velocity measurement nearsurface region used benchmarking current meter equipment main component vmcm two orthogonal cosine response propeller sensor directly measure component horizontal velocity parallel ax orientation instrument respect magnetic north sensed fluxgate compass permit evaluate direction flux providing angle axis respect magnetic north microprocessor rotates xy coordinate conventional east–west north–south component velocity done sample interval end record interval conventional component velocity averaged average stored cassette magnetic tape component system bearing retainer end cap outer bearing race ball retainer bearing ball encoder epoxy noryl plastic disk four magnet pressure window aluminum disk two magnetodiodes mounted asymmetrically printed circuit ring hub shaft inner race machined function magnetodiodes detecting rotation propeller sensor incorporated system vector averaging electronics us pulse magnetodiodes instrument heading fluxgate compass calculate record velocity component way et al upgraded electronics redesigning vector measuring circuitry data acquisition storage component retaining instead propeller sensor assembly proved reliable several test accomplished pressure case house electronics appendage propeller mounted first design late vmcm approximately high mass kg air original vmcm longer commercially available egg currently edgetech electronics component outdated difficult impossible find like many electronic component original flux gate compass longer available propeller sensor innovation brought vmcm current meter result choice biaxial propeller sensor developed accurate cosine response design instrument flow interference instrument body minimized cosine response refers propeller respond component flow parallel axis rotation revolution rate proportional magnitude flow time cosine angle axle flow vector angular response function propeller cosinusoidal two sensor right angle ax horizontal plane measure orthogonal component horizontal velocity directly computation component necessary though rotated instrument reference frame conventional east–west north–south component summing component accomplishes vector averaging advantage propeller cosine response widely recognized weller davis designed propeller sensor location within pressure cage order obtain response close possible ideal cosinusoidal angular response fabricated testis several family propeller found best response dual propeller two propeller fixed axle sensor two fivebladed degree pitch propeller diameter cm propeller hard anodized epoxy coated exterior protected zinc anode made polycarbonate plastic lexan recently noryl propeller sensor make use cartesian coordinate system provide orthogonal velocity component horizontal plane measured coordinate need rotated conventional direction east–west north–south pressure cage pressure case house electronics appendage propeller mounted fabricated av titanium alloy rod cm diameter withstand higher yield strength steel
Netflix button,"The Netflix button is a button available on many modern remote controllers, used to directly connect to the popular streaming service Netflix. It was initially implemented in America in 2011. In 2015, the button was added to European remotes. This button sends a Netflix hotkey command to the television or streaming player and opens up the Netflix app.

Adoption
Many popular TV companies have adopted the Netflix button, including: LG, Samsung, Sony, and Hisense. Some of the TVs have made it to a list that Netflix has dubbed the ""Netflix Recommended TVs"". These are TVs that have a Netflix button on them which Netflix recommends to their subscribers to get the best viewing experience for their service. Some low-end laptop computers in emerging markets also ship with streaming buttons (or rather keys), typically including Netflix. Brazilian OEM Positivo has been including Netflix keys on their laptops since 2018.

Mechanism
The Netflix button only works on those TVs that support it, this includes: ""Smart TVs, game consoles, streaming media players, set-top boxes, and Blu-ray players"". Although hard-programmed on many devices, the Netflix button as of recent has been opening up to re-purposing. On the NVIDIA Shield, the remote has a Netflix button that can be reprogrammed very easily using a program on the device.
Netflix, in 2015, had also open-sourced a design for consumers to create their own Netflix button with additional features. Labeled ""The Switch"", this homemade device can dim the lights, silence incoming phone calls, order take-out, and open Netflix with one button press. The Switch is part of a series of DIY projects Netflix created, knows as ""Netflix Make It"" for their consumers to learn more about programming and create their own projects.

Criticism
The introduction of the Netflix button was criticized; an article from ""The Verge"" says that the button comes as a constant advertisement on a device you had already paid up to thousands of dollars for. Arguing that the buttons are ""putting making money ahead of actual user experience or design"". Initially, concerns had been raised about whether the button violates the principle of net neutrality, by putting its streaming competitors in disadvantage. A common complaint is that someone who is not a Netflix subscriber who accidentally presses the Netflix button is taken to a useless screen.
A popular option for streaming services, Roku, has 4 separate streaming buttons on their remotes. Each of these buttons cost the streaming service one dollar per unit sold. The Roku has many different buttons for the consumer to choose, but most of the remotes feature a Netflix button on them.
By the early 2020s other streaming services and media, such as Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Samsung TV Plus, Spotify, Crunchyroll, YouTube, and Disney+, also had got their own buttons.

Bioconcentration,"In aquatic toxicology, bioconcentration is the accumulation of a water-borne chemical substance in an organism exposed to the water.
There are several ways in which to measure and assess bioaccumulation and bioconcentration.  These include: octanol-water partition coefficients (KOW), bioconcentration factors (BCF), bioaccumulation factors (BAF) and biota-sediment accumulation factor (BSAF).  Each of these can be calculated using either empirical data or measurements, as well as from mathematical models. One of these mathematical models is a fugacity-based BCF model developed by Don Mackay.
Bioconcentration factor can also be expressed as the ratio of the concentration of a chemical in an organism to the concentration of the chemical in the surrounding environment. The BCF is a measure of the extent of chemical sharing between an organism and the surrounding environment.
In surface water, the BCF is the ratio of a chemical's concentration in an organism to the chemical's aqueous concentration.  BCF is often expressed in units of liter per kilogram (ratio of mg of chemical per kg of organism to mg of chemical per liter of water). BCF can simply be an observed ratio, or it can be the prediction of a partitioning model. A partitioning model is based on assumptions that chemicals partition between water and aquatic organisms as well as the idea that chemical equilibrium exists between the organisms and the aquatic environment in which it is found

Calculation
Bioconcentration can be described by a bioconcentration factor (BCF), which is the ratio of the chemical concentration in an organism or biota to the concentration in water:

Bioconcentration factors can also be related to the octanol-water partition coefficient, Kow. The octanol-water partition coefficient (Kow) is correlated with the potential for a chemical to bioaccumulate in organisms; the BCF can be predicted from log Kow, via computer programs based on structure activity relationship (SAR) or through the linear equation:

Modern physics,"Modern physics is a branch of physics that developed in the early 20th century and onward or branches greatly influenced by early 20th century physics. Notable branches of modern physics include quantum mechanics, special relativity, and general relativity.
Classical physics is typically concerned with everyday conditions: speeds are much lower than the speed of light, sizes are much greater than that of atoms, and energies are relatively small. Modern physics, however, is concerned with more extreme conditions, such as high velocities that are comparable to the speed of light (special relativity), small distances comparable to the atomic radius (quantum mechanics), and very high energies (relativity). In general, quantum and relativistic effects are believed to exist across all scales, although these effects may be very small at human scale. While quantum mechanics is compatible with special relativity (See: Relativistic quantum mechanics), one of the unsolved problems in physics is the unification of quantum mechanics and general relativity, which the Standard Model of particle physics currently cannot account for.
Modern physics is an effort to understand the underlying processes of the interactions of matter using the tools of science and engineering. In a literal sense, the term modern physics means up-to-date physics. In this sense, a significant portion of so-called classical physics is modern. However, since roughly 1890, new discoveries have caused significant paradigm shifts: especially the advent of quantum mechanics (QM) and relativity (ER). Physics that incorporates elements of either QM or ER (or both) is said to be modern physics. It is in this latter sense that the term is generally used.
Modern physics is often encountered when dealing with extreme conditions. Quantum mechanical effects tend to appear when dealing with ""lows"" (low temperatures, small distances), while relativistic effects tend to appear when dealing with ""highs"" (high velocities, large distances), the ""middles"" being classical behavior. For example, when analyzing the behavior of a gas at room temperature, most phenomena will involve the (classical) Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. However, near absolute zero, the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution fails to account for the observed behavior of the gas, and the (modern) Fermi–Dirac or Bose–Einstein distributions have to be used instead.

Very often, it is possible to find – or ""retrieve"" – the classical behavior from the modern description by analyzing the modern description at low speeds and large distances (by taking a limit, or by making an approximation). When doing so, the result is called the classical limit.

Hallmark experiments
These are generally considered to be experiments regarded leading to the foundation of modern physics:

Arens–van Dorp synthesis,"The Arens–van Dorp synthesis is a name reaction in organic chemistry. It describes the addition of lithiated ethoxyacetylenes to ketones to give propargyl alcohols, which can undergo further reaction to form α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, or esters. There is also a variation of this reaction called the Isler modification, where the acetylide anion is generated in situ from β-chlorovinyl ether using lithium amide.

Amateur chemistry,"Amateur chemistry or home chemistry is the pursuit of chemistry as a private hobby. Amateur chemistry is usually done with whatever chemicals are available at disposal at the privacy of one's home. It should not be confused with clandestine chemistry, which involves the illicit production of controlled drugs.[a] Notable amateur chemists include Oliver Sacks and Sir Edward Elgar.

History
Origins
Amateur chemistry shares its early history with that of chemistry in general.  Pioneers of modern chemistry such as Robert Boyle and Antoine Lavoisier were gentlemen scientists who pursued their research independently from their source of income.  Only with the coming of the Industrial Revolution, and the rise of universities as research institutions, did any significant distinction between amateurs and professionals emerge.
Nevertheless, amateur progress lasted well into the 19th century.  For example, in 1886, Charles Martin Hall co-invented the Hall-Héroult process for extracting aluminium from its oxide whilst working in a woodshed behind his family home.
The history of amateur chemistry ties in well with that of chemistry in general. The history of chemistry represents a time span from ancient history to the present. By 1000 BC, civilizations used technologies that would eventually form the basis to the various branches of chemistry. These processes include extracting metals from ores, making pottery and glazes, fermenting beer and wine, extracting chemicals from plants for medicine and perfume, rendering fat into soap, making glass, and making alloys like bronze.

Chemistry as a hobby
Throughout much of the 20th century, amateur chemistry was an unexceptional hobby, with high-quality chemistry sets readily available, and laboratory suppliers freely selling to hobbyists. For example, Linus Pauling had no difficulty in procuring potassium cyanide at the age of eleven. Many academics, from researchers to university professors, and even Nobel prize laureates, have acknowledged that at least part of their interest in sciences could be traced back to chemistry sets and home labs when they were young. These include Dorothy Hodgkin, Robert F. Curl, George A. Olah, Rudolph A. Marcus, Louis J. Ignarro, Richard Schrock, Roger Y. Tsien, William D. Phillips, Steven Weinberg, Peter Licence, etc. However, due to increasing concerns about terrorism, drugs, and safety, suppliers became increasingly reluctant to sell to amateurs, and chemistry sets were steadily toned down. This trend has gradually continued, leaving hobbyists in many parts of the world without access to most reagents.
Even as recently as 2023, amateur chemists on forums and YouTube channels have been credited by academic researchers for suggesting and discussing novel viable synthetic routes before full investigations by the latter.

Usefulness as a learning and work training tool
Home-based chemistry labs were explored as a way to remotely teach students during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially since many local and state-level governments across the world imposed lockdowns or other types of restrictions to contain the spread of the virus.

Notable amateur chemists
Internet pioneer Vint Cerf, Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, and Hewlett Packard co-founder David Packard all used to practice amateur chemistry.
British neurologist Oliver Sacks was a keen amateur chemist in his youth, as described in his memoir Uncle Tungsten: Memories of a Chemical Boyhood.
Nobel Prize winning chemist Linus Pauling practised amateur chemistry in his youth.
Wolfram Research co-founder Theodore Gray is a keen amateur chemist and element collector.  His exploits (most notably the construction of a wooden table in the shape of the periodic table, having compartments holding real samples of each element) earned him the 2002 Ig Nobel prize for chemistry, which he accepted as a great honor.  He writes a column for Popular Science magazine, featuring his home experiments.
Amateur rocketeer (and later NASA engineer) Homer Hickham, together with his fellow Rocket Boys, experimented with a range of home-made rocket propellants.  These included ""Rocket Candy"" made from potassium nitrate and sugar, and ""Zincoshine"" made from zinc and sulfur held together with moonshine alcohol.
Composer Sir Edward Elgar practised amateur chemistry from a laboratory erected in his back garden. The original manuscript of the prelude to The Kingdom is stained with chemicals.
Robert Boyle is largely regarded today as the first modern chemist, and therefore one of the founders of modern chemistry, and one of the pioneers of modern experimental scientific method.
Maurice Ward, a hairdresser and amateur chemist who invented the thermal insulating material called Starlite.
Robert Cornelius, inventor, businessman and lamp manufacturer credited for creating the first photographic self-portrait in 1839.

Couloir,"A couloir (French: [ku.lwaʁ], ""passage"" or ""corridor"") is a narrow gully with a steep gradient in a mountainous terrain.

Geology

A couloir may be a seam, scar, or fissure, or vertical crevasse in an otherwise solid mountain mass. Though often hemmed in by sheer cliff walls, couloirs may also be less well-defined, and may often simply be a line of broken talus or scree ascending the mountainside and bordered by trees, rocks or other natural features. Couloirs are especially significant in winter months when they may be filled in with snow or ice, and become much more noticeable than in warmer months when most of the snow and ice may recede. These physical features make the use of couloirs popular for both mountaineering and extreme skiing.

C1 chemistry,"C1 chemistry is the chemistry of one-carbon molecules.  Although many compounds and ions contain only one carbon, stable and abundant C-1 feedstocks are the focus of research.  Four compounds are of major industrial importance: methane, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and methanol.  Technologies that interconvert these species are often used massively to match supply to demand.

Industrial processes
Carbon monoxide and methanol are important chemical feedstocks.  CO is utilized by myriad carbonylation reactions.  Together with hydrogen, it is the feed for the Fischer–Tropsch process, which affords liquid fuels.  Methanol is the precursor to acetic acid, dimethyl ether, formaldehyde, and many methyl compounds (esters, amines, halides). A larger-scale application is methanol to olefins, which produces ethylene and propylene.
In contrast to carbon monoxide and methanol, methane and carbon dioxide have limited uses as feedstocks for chemicals and fuels.  This disparity contrasts with the relative abundance of methane and carbon dioxide.  Methane is often partially converted to carbon monoxide for utilization in Fischer-Tropsch processes. Of interest for upgrading methane is its oxidative coupling:

2CH4 + O2 → C2H4 + 2H2O
Conversion of carbon dioxide to unsaturated hydrocarbons via electrochemical reduction is a hopeful avenue of research. Still, no stable and economic technology has yet been developed.

Biochemistry

Methane, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and methanol are also substrates and products of enzymatic processes.  In methanogenesis, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and methanol are converted to methane, provided suitable reducing agents. Methanogenesis by methanogenic archaea is reversible.
In photosynthesis, carbon dioxide and water are converted to sugars (and O2), the energy for this (thermally) uphill reaction being provided by sunlight.

Philosophy,"Philosophy ('love of wisdom' in Ancient Greek) is a systematic study of general and fundamental questions concerning topics like existence, reason, knowledge, value, mind, and language. It is a rational and critical inquiry that reflects on its methods and assumptions.
Historically, many of the individual sciences, such as physics and psychology, formed part of philosophy. However, they are considered separate academic disciplines in the modern sense of the term. Influential traditions in the history of philosophy include Western, Arabic–Persian, Indian, and Chinese philosophy. Western philosophy originated in Ancient Greece and covers a wide area of philosophical subfields. A central topic in Arabic–Persian philosophy is the relation between reason and revelation. Indian philosophy combines the spiritual problem of how to reach enlightenment with the exploration of the nature of reality and the ways of arriving at knowledge. Chinese philosophy focuses principally on practical issues about right social conduct, government, and self-cultivation.
Major branches of philosophy are epistemology, ethics, logic, and metaphysics. Epistemology studies what knowledge is and how to acquire it. Ethics investigates moral principles and what constitutes right conduct. Logic is the study of correct reasoning and explores how good arguments can be distinguished from bad ones. Metaphysics examines the most general features of reality, existence, objects, and properties. Other subfields are aesthetics, philosophy of language, philosophy of mind, philosophy of religion, philosophy of science, philosophy of mathematics, philosophy of history, and political philosophy. Within each branch, there are competing schools of philosophy that promote different principles, theories, or methods.
Philosophers use a great variety of methods to arrive at philosophical knowledge. They include conceptual analysis, reliance on common sense and intuitions, use of thought experiments, analysis of ordinary language, description of experience, and critical questioning. Philosophy is related to many other fields, including the sciences, mathematics, business, law, and journalism. It provides an interdisciplinary perspective and studies the scope and fundamental concepts of these fields. It also investigates their methods and ethical implications.

Etymology
The word philosophy comes from the Ancient Greek words φίλος (philos) 'love' and σοφία (sophia) 'wisdom'. Some sources say that the term was coined by the pre-Socratic philosopher Pythagoras, but this is not certain.

The word entered the English language primarily from Old French and Anglo-Norman starting around 1175 CE. The French philosophie is itself a borrowing from the Latin philosophia. The term philosophy acquired the meanings of ""advanced study of the speculative subjects (logic, ethics, physics, and metaphysics)"", ""deep wisdom consisting of love of truth and virtuous living"", ""profound learning as transmitted by the ancient writers"", and ""the study of the fundamental nature of knowledge, reality, and existence, and the basic limits of human understanding"".
Before the modern age, the term philosophy was used in a wide sense. It included most forms of rational inquiry, such as the individual sciences, as its subdisciplines. For instance, natural philosophy was a major branch of philosophy. This branch of philosophy encompassed a wide range of fields, including disciplines like physics, chemistry, and biology. An example of this usage is the 1687 book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica by Isaac Newton. This book referred to natural philosophy in its title, but it is today considered a book of physics.
The meaning of philosophy changed toward the end of the modern period when it acquired the more narrow meaning common today. In this new sense, the term is mainly associated with disciplines like metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics. Among other topics, it covers the rational study of reality, knowledge, and values. It is distinguished from other disciplines of rational inquiry such as the empirical sciences and mathematics.

Conceptions of philosophy
General conception
The practice of philosophy is characterized by several general features: it is a form of rational inquiry, it aims to be systematic, and it tends to critically reflect on its own methods and presuppositions. It requires attentively thinking long and carefully about the provocative, vexing, and enduring problems central to the human condition.
The philosophical pursuit of wisdom involves asking general and fundamental questions. It often does not result in straightforward answers but may help a person to better understand the topic, examine their life, dispel confusion, and overcome prejudices and self-deceptive ideas associated with common sense. For example, Socrates stated that ""the unexamined life is not worth living"" to highlight the role of philosophical inquiry in understanding one's own existence.

Desert exploration,"Desert exploration is the deliberate and scientific exploration of deserts, the arid regions of the earth. It is only incidentally concerned with the culture and livelihood of native desert dwellers. People have struggled to live in deserts and the surrounding semi-arid lands for millennia. Nomads have moved their flocks and herds to wherever grazing is available, and oases have provided opportunities for a more settled way of life. Many, such as the Bushmen in the Kalahari, the Aborigines in Australia and various Indigenous peoples of the Americas, were originally hunter-gatherers.  Many trade routes have been forged across deserts, especially across the Sahara Desert, and traditionally were used by caravans of camels carrying salt, gold, ivory and other goods. Large numbers of slaves were also taken northwards across the Sahara. Today, some mineral extraction also takes place in deserts, and the uninterrupted sunlight gives potential for the capture of large quantities of solar energy.
Many people think of deserts as consisting of extensive areas of billowing sand dunes because that is the way they are often depicted on TV and in films, but deserts do not always look like this. Across the world, around 20% of desert is sand, varying from only 2% in North America to 30% in Australia and over 45% in Central Asia. Where sand does occur, it is usually in large quantities in the form of sand sheets or extensive areas of dunes. The following sections list deserts around the world, and their explorers. Expeditions are listed by their leaders; details of other expedition members may be found via the links.

Kalahari Desert
Sahara Desert
The Romans organized expeditions to cross the Sahara desert with five different routes. All these expeditions were supported by legionaries and had mainly a commercial purpose. One of the main reasons of the explorations was to get gold using the camel to transport it.:
through the western Sahara, toward the Niger River and present day Timbuktu.
through the Tibesti mountains, toward Lake Chad and present day Nigeria
through the Nile river, toward present day Uganda.
though the western coast of Africa, toward the Canary Islands and the Cape Verde islands.
through the Red Sea, toward present day Somalia and perhaps Tanzania.
Michael Asher & Mariantonietta Peru – made the first recorded crossing of the Sahara from west to east, by camel and on foot, from Nouakchott, Mauretania, to Abu Simbel, Egypt, 1986–87, a distance of 4500 miles Ref: The Modern Explorers. Thames & Hudson. London 2013 Michael Asher lived for 3 years with the Kababish nomads in the Sudan.
Eva Dickson – was the first woman to cross the Sahara Desert by car. In 1932 she met the former spouse of Karen Blixen, Baron Bror von Blixen-Finecke, in Kenya, and they became lovers. After her meeting with Blixen in 1932, she took a bet and drove by car from Nairobi to Stockholm in 1932, thus becoming the first woman to have crossed the Sahara by car.
Heinrich Barth – crossed the Sahara during his travels in Africa and the Middle East during 1845–1847.
James Richardson – explored the Sahara and Sudan he died in the notorious hamada (a stony desert) in the Western Sahara.
Friedrich Gerhard Rohlfs – German geographer. First person the cross Africa north to south. Named a place Regenfeld near Dakhla Oasis in southern Egypt after experiencing a rare occurrence of desert rain.
Karl Alfred von Zittel German palaeontologist who accompanied Rohlfs.
Henri Duveyrier – He undertook a number of fossil-hunting explorations in the Sahara.
Albert-Félix de Lapparent – Explorer of the northern and western parts of the Sahara.
Victor Loche –  first identified the sand cat (Felis margarita) while exploring the North Sahara.
Joseph Ritchie – sent to find the course of the River Niger and the location of Timbuktu. He died in Murzuk.
Helen Thayer – 20th-century walker and explorer.
Michiel Franken- First man to ride a sidecar (BMW i8) through the sahara

Asia
Arabian Desert has been populated since prehistory. Rub' al Khali or the Empty Quarter in its remote center is one of the largest continuous bodies of sand in the world. It was recently explored by Europeans:
Bertram Thomas in 1931 and
St. John Philby in 1932: first documented journeys by Westerners
Wilfred Thesiger in 1946–50 crossed it several times and mapped large parts of it
In June 1950, a US Air Force expedition crossed the Rub' al Khali from Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, to central Yemen and back in trucks to collect specimens for the Smithsonian Institution and to test desert survival procedures.
Youngho Nam (Korean) in 2013 crossed on foot 1,000 km from ""Salalah, Oman"" to ""Liwa, United Arab Emirates""

Gaelic Ireland,"Gaelic Ireland (Irish: Éire Ghaelach) was the Gaelic political and social order, and associated culture, that existed in Ireland from the late prehistoric era until the 17th century. It comprised the whole island before Anglo-Normans conquered parts of Ireland in the 1170s. Thereafter, it comprised that part of the country not under foreign dominion at a given time (i.e. the part beyond The Pale). For most of its history, Gaelic Ireland was a ""patchwork"" hierarchy of territories ruled by a hierarchy of kings or chiefs, who were chosen or elected through tanistry. Warfare between these territories was common. Traditionally, a powerful ruler was acknowledged as High King of Ireland. Society was made up of clans and, like the rest of Europe, was structured hierarchically according to class. Throughout this period, the economy was mainly pastoral and money was generally not used. A Gaelic Irish style of dress, music, dance, sport and art can be identified, with Irish art later merging with Anglo-Saxon styles to create Insular art.
Gaelic Ireland was initially pagan and had an oral culture maintained by traditional Gaelic storytellers/historians, the seanchaidhthe. Writing, in the form of inscription in the ogham alphabet, began in the protohistoric period, perhaps as early as the 1st century. The conversion to Christianity, beginning in the 5th century, accompanied the introduction of literature. In the Middle Ages, Irish mythology and Brehon law were recorded by Irish monks, albeit partly Christianized. Gaelic Irish monasteries were important centres of learning. Irish missionaries and scholars were influential in western Europe and helped to spread Christianity to much of Britain and parts of mainland Europe.
In the 9th century, Vikings began raiding and founding settlements along Ireland's coasts and waterways, which became its first large towns. Over time, these settlers were assimilated and became the Norse-Gaels. After the Anglo-Norman invasion of 1169–71, large swathes of Ireland came under the control of Norman lords, leading to centuries of conflict with the native Irish. The King of England claimed sovereignty over this territory – the Lordship of Ireland – and the island as a whole. However, the Gaelic system continued in areas outside Anglo-Norman control. The territory under English control gradually shrank to an area known as the Pale and, outside this, many Hiberno-Norman lords adopted Gaelic culture.
In 1542, the Lordship of Ireland became the Kingdom of Ireland when Henry VIII of England was given the title of King of Ireland by the Parliament of Ireland. The English then began to extend their control over the island. By 1607, Ireland was fully under English control, bringing the old Gaelic political and social order to an end.

Culture and society
Gaelic culture and society were centred around the fine (explained below). Gaelic Ireland had a rich oral culture and appreciation of deeper and intellectual pursuits. Filí and draoithe (druids) were held in high regard during Pagan times and orally passed down the history and traditions of their people. Later, many of their spiritual and intellectual tasks were passed on to Christian monks, after said religion prevailed from the 5th century onwards. However, the filí continued to hold a high position. Poetry, music, storytelling, literature and other art forms were highly prized and cultivated in both pagan and Christian Gaelic Ireland. Hospitality, bonds of kinship and the fulfilment of social and ritual responsibilities were highly important.
Like Britain, Gaelic Ireland consisted not of one single unified kingdom, but several. The main kingdoms were Ulaid (Ulster), Mide (Meath), Laigin (Leinster), Muma (Munster, consisting of Iarmuman, Tuadmumain and Desmumain), Connacht, Bréifne (Breffny), In Tuaiscert (The North), and Airgíalla (Oriel). Each of these overkingdoms were built upon lordships known as túatha (singular: túath). Law tracts from the early 700s describe a hierarchy of kings: kings of túath subject to kings of several túatha who again were subject to the regional overkings. Already before the 8th century these overkingdoms had begun to replace the túatha as the basic sociopolitical unit.

Religion and mythology
Paganism
Before Christianization, the Gaelic Irish were polytheistic or pagan. They had many gods and goddesses, which generally have parallels in the pantheons of other European nations. Two groups of supernatural beings who appear throughout Irish mythology—the Tuatha Dé Danann and Fomorians—are believed to represent the Gaelic pantheon. They were also animists, believing that all aspects of the natural world contained spirits, and that these spirits could be communicated with. Burial practices—which included burying food, weapons, and ornaments with the dead—suggest a belief in life after death. Some have equated this afterlife with the Otherworld realms known as Magh Meall and Tír na nÓg in Irish mythology.

Surroundings,"Surroundings, or environs is an area around a given physical or geographical point or place.  The exact definition depends on the field. Surroundings can also be used in geography (when it is more precisely known as vicinity, or vicinage) and mathematics, as well as philosophy, with the literal or metaphorically extended definition.
In thermodynamics, the term (and its synonym, environment) is used in a more restricted sense, meaning everything outside the thermodynamic system. Often, the simplifying assumptions are that energy and matter may move freely within the surroundings, and that the surroundings have a uniform composition.

Conductor (software),"Conductor is a free and open-source microservice orchestration software platform originally developed by Netflix.
Conductor was developed by Netflix to solve the problems of orchestrating microservices and business processes at scale in a cloud native environment.  It was released under the Apache License 2.0 and has been adopted by companies looking to orchestrate their processes at scale in a cloud native environment.  
Conductor belongs to a set of software products that allows developers to build resilient, high-scale, cloud-native stateful applications using stateless primitives.

Architecture
Conductor server is written in Java with APIs exposed over HTTP and gRPC interfaces making it possible to do language agnostic development. A set of client libraries are made available by Netflix and community in Java, Python and Go. 
Conductor uses a lightweight JSON based schema with rich programming language constructs such as fork/join, switch case, loops and exception handling to define the flows. 
At the heart of Conductor is a queuing system that is used to schedule tasks and manage the process flows.  Conductor leverages a pluggable model allowing different implementations of the queuing system.  Open source version uses Dyno-Queues developed at Netflix for queuing as default implementation.
The workflows are defined as the orchestration among the tasks which can be a system level construct such as fork, join, switch, loop, an external HTTP endpoint implementing business logic or a task worker running outside of Conductor servers and listening for work to be scheduled by the server.  The workers communicate with the server using pre-defined APIs over HTTP or gRPC.  Conductor provides lightweight libraries to manage worker states in Java, Python and Go and additional languages can be used to implement logic using provided APIs.  
Conductor uses pluggable architecture model allowing for different databases to store its states. The current version has support for Redis (Stand-alone, Sentinel, Cluster and Dynomite), Postgres, Mysql, Cassandra and uses Elasticsearch as indexing mechanism.
The UI is written in ReactJS and provides ability to search, visualize and manage the workflow states.

Cloud Hosted Services
Orkes - was founded by the creators of Netflix Conductor and provides cloud managed offering of Netflix Conductor in various clouds and in data center.

Arctic Ocean,"The Arctic Ocean is the smallest and shallowest of the world's five oceanic divisions. It spans an area of approximately 14,060,000 km2 (5,430,000 sq mi) and is the coldest of the world's oceans. The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) recognizes it as an ocean, although some oceanographers call it the Arctic Mediterranean Sea. It has also been described as an estuary of the Atlantic Ocean. It is also seen as the northernmost part of the all-encompassing world ocean.
The Arctic Ocean includes the North Pole region in the middle of the Northern Hemisphere and extends south to about 60°N. The Arctic Ocean is surrounded by Eurasia and North America, and the borders follow topographic features: the Bering Strait on the Pacific side and the Greenland Scotland Ridge on the Atlantic side. It is mostly covered by sea ice throughout the year and almost completely in winter. The Arctic Ocean's surface temperature and salinity vary seasonally as the ice cover melts and freezes; its salinity is the lowest on average of the five major oceans, due to low evaporation, heavy fresh water inflow from rivers and streams, and limited connection and outflow to surrounding oceanic waters with higher salinities. The summer shrinking of the ice has been quoted at 50%. The US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) uses satellite data to provide a daily record of Arctic sea ice cover and the rate of melting compared to an average period and specific past years, showing a continuous decline in sea ice extent. In September 2012, the Arctic ice extent reached a new record minimum. Compared to the average extent (1979–2000), the sea ice had diminished by 49%.

History
North America
Human habitation in the North American polar region goes back at least 17,000–50,000 years, during the Wisconsin glaciation. Falling sea levels allowed people to move across the Bering land bridge that joined Siberia to northwestern North America (Alaska), leading to the Settlement of the Americas.

Early Paleo-Eskimo groups included the Pre-Dorset (c. 3200–850 BC); the Saqqaq culture of Greenland (2500–800 BC); the Independence I and Independence II cultures of northeastern Canada and Greenland (c. 2400–1800 BC and c. 800–1 BC); and the Groswater of Labrador and Nunavik. The Dorset culture spread across Arctic North America between 500 BC and AD 1500. The Dorset were the last major Paleo-Eskimo culture in the Arctic before the migration east from present-day Alaska of the Thule people, ancestors of the modern Inuit.
The Thule Tradition lasted from about 200 BC to AD 1600, arising around the Bering Strait and later encompassing almost the entire Arctic region of North America. The Thule people were the ancestors of the Inuit, who now live in Alaska, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Nunavik (northern Quebec), Labrador and Greenland.

Europe
For much of European history, the north polar regions remained largely unexplored and their geography conjectural. Pytheas of Massilia recorded an account of a journey northward in 325 BC, to a land he called ""Eschate Thule"", where the Sun only set for three hours each day and the water was replaced by a congealed substance ""on which one can neither walk nor sail"". He was probably describing loose sea ice known today as ""growlers"" or ""bergy bits""; his ""Thule"" was probably Norway, though the Faroe Islands or Shetland have also been suggested.

Early cartographers were unsure whether to draw the region around the North Pole as land (as in Johannes Ruysch's map of 1507, or Gerardus Mercator's map of 1595) or water (as with Martin Waldseemüller's world map of 1507). The fervent desire of European merchants for a northern passage, the Northern Sea Route or the Northwest Passage, to ""Cathay"" (China) caused water to win out, and by 1723 mapmakers such as Johann Homann featured an extensive ""Oceanus Septentrionalis"" at the northern edge of their charts.
The few expeditions to penetrate much beyond the Arctic Circle in that era added only small islands, such as Novaya Zemlya (11th century) and Spitzbergen (1596), though, since these were often surrounded by pack-ice, their northern limits were not so clear. The makers of navigational charts, more conservative than some of the more fanciful cartographers, tended to leave the region blank, with only fragments of known coastline sketched in.

19th century
This lack of knowledge of what lay north of the shifting barrier of ice gave rise to a number of conjectures. In England and other European nations, the myth of an ""Open Polar Sea"" was persistent. John Barrow, longtime Second Secretary of the British Admiralty, promoted exploration of the region from 1818 to 1845 in search of this.
In the United States in the 1850s and 1860s, the explorers Elisha Kane and Isaac Israel Hayes both claimed to have seen part of this elusive body of water. Even quite late in the century, the eminent authority Matthew Fontaine Maury included a description of the Open Polar Sea in his textbook Th",Oceans,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Ocean,1,arctic ocean smallest shallowest world five oceanic division span area approximately km sq mi coldest world ocean international hydrographic organization iho recognizes ocean although oceanographer call arctic mediterranean sea also described estuary atlantic ocean also seen northernmost part allencompassing world ocean arctic ocean includes north pole region middle northern hemisphere extends south °n arctic ocean surrounded eurasia north america border follow topographic feature bering strait pacific side greenland scotland ridge atlantic side mostly covered sea ice throughout year almost completely winter arctic ocean surface temperature salinity vary seasonally ice cover melt freeze salinity lowest average five major ocean due low evaporation heavy fresh water inflow river stream limited connection outflow surrounding oceanic water higher salinity summer shrinking ice quoted u national snow ice data center nsidc us satellite data provide daily record arctic sea ice cover rate melting compared average period specific past year showing continuous decline sea ice extent september arctic ice extent reached new record minimum compared average extent – sea ice diminished history north america human habitation north american polar region go back least – year wisconsin glaciation falling sea level allowed people move across bering land bridge joined siberia northwestern north america alaska leading settlement america early paleoeskimo group included predorset c – bc saqqaq culture greenland – bc independence independence ii culture northeastern canada greenland c – bc c – bc groswater labrador nunavik dorset culture spread across arctic north america bc ad dorset last major paleoeskimo culture arctic migration east presentday alaska thule people ancestor modern inuit thule tradition lasted bc ad arising around bering strait later encompassing almost entire arctic region north america thule people ancestor inuit live alaska northwest territory nunavut nunavik northern quebec labrador greenland europe much european history north polar region remained largely unexplored geography conjectural pytheas massilia recorded account journey northward bc land called eschate thule sun set three hour day water replaced congealed substance one neither walk sail probably describing loose sea ice known today growler bergy bit thule probably norway though faroe island shetland also suggested early cartographer unsure whether draw region around north pole land johannes ruyschs map gerardus mercator map water martin waldseemüllers world map fervent desire european merchant northern passage northern sea route northwest passage cathay china caused water win mapmakers johann homann featured extensive oceanus septentrionalis northern edge chart expedition penetrate much beyond arctic circle era added small island novaya zemlya th century spitzbergen though since often surrounded packice northern limit clear maker navigational chart conservative fanciful cartographer tended leave region blank fragment known coastline sketched th century lack knowledge lay north shifting barrier ice gave rise number conjecture england european nation myth open polar sea persistent john barrow longtime second secretary british admiralty promoted exploration region search united state explorer elisha kane isaac israel hayes claimed seen part elusive body water even quite late century eminent authority matthew fontaine maury included description open polar sea textbook th
Model-based clustering,"In statistics, cluster analysis is the algorithmic grouping of objects into homogeneous
groups based on numerical measurements. Model-based clustering based on a statistical model for the data, usually a mixture model. This has several advantages, including a principled statistical basis for clustering,
and ways to choose the number of clusters, to choose the best clustering model, to assess the uncertainty of the clustering, and to identify outliers that do not belong to any group.

Then in its simplest form, model-based clustering views each component
of the mixture model as a cluster, estimates the model parameters, and assigns
each observation to cluster corresponding to its most likely mixture component.

Trophic state index,"The Trophic State Index (TSI) is a classification system designed to rate water bodies based on the amount of biological productivity they sustain. Although the term ""trophic index"" is commonly applied to lakes, any surface water body may be indexed.
The TSI of a water body is rated on a scale from zero to one hundred. Under the TSI scale, water bodies may be defined as:

oligotrophic (TSI 0–40, having the least amount of biological productivity, ""good"" water quality);
mesotrophic (TSI 40–60, having a moderate level of biological productivity, ""fair"" water quality); or
eutrophic to hypereutrophic (TSI 60–100, having the highest amount of biological productivity, ""poor"" water quality).
The quantities of nitrogen, phosphorus, and other biologically useful nutrients are the primary determinants of a water body's TSI. Nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus tend to be limiting resources in standing water bodies, so increased concentrations tend to result in increased plant growth, followed by corollary increases in subsequent trophic levels. Consequently, trophic index may sometimes be used to make a rough estimate of biological condition of water bodies.

Carlson's Trophic State Index
Carlson's index was proposed by Robert Carlson in his 1977 seminal paper, ""A Trophic State Index for Lakes"". It is one of the more commonly used trophic indices and is the trophic index used by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The trophic state is defined as the total weight of biomass in a given water body at the time of measurement. Because they are of public concern, the Carlson index uses the algal biomass as an objective classifier of a lake or other water body's trophic status. According to the US EPA, the Carlson Index should only be used with lakes that have relatively few rooted plants and non-algal turbidity sources.

Because they tend to correlate, three independent variables can be used to calculate the Carlson Index: chlorophyll pigments, total phosphorus and Secchi depth. Of these three, chlorophyll will probably yield the most accurate measures, as it is the most accurate predictor of biomass. Phosphorus may be a more accurate estimation of a water body's summer trophic status than chlorophyll if the measurements are made during the winter. Finally, the Secchi depth is probably the least accurate measure, but also the most affordable and expedient one. Consequently, citizen monitoring programs and other volunteer or large-scale surveys will often use the Secchi depth. By translating the Secchi transparency values to a log base 2 scale, each successive doubling of biomass is represented as a whole integer index number. The Secchi depth, which measures water transparency, indicates the concentration of dissolved and particulate material in the water, which in turn can be used to derive the biomass. This relationship is expressed in the following equation:

where z = the depth at which the disk disappears,
I0 is the intensity of light striking the water's surface,
Iz is about 10% of I0 and is considered a constant,
kw is a coefficient for the attenuation of light by water and dissolved substances,
α is treated as a constant with the units of square meters per milligram and
C is the concentration of particulate matter in units for milligrams per cubic meter.

Trophic classifications
A lake is usually classified as being in one of three possible classes: oligotrophic, mesotrophic or eutrophic. Lakes with extreme trophic indices may also be considered hyperoligotrophic or hypereutrophic (also ""hypertrophic""). The table below demonstrates how the index values translate into trophic classes.

Oligotrophic lakes generally host very little or no aquatic vegetation and are relatively clear, while eutrophic lakes tend to host large quantities of organisms, including algal blooms. Each trophic class supports different types of fish and other organisms, as well. If the algal biomass in a lake or other water body reaches too high a concentration (say >80 TSI), massive fish die-offs may occur as decomposing biomass deoxygenates the water.

Oligotrophic

Desert planet,"A desert planet, also known as a dry planet, an arid planet, or a dune planet, is a type of terrestrial planet that is arid at the surface level.
Deserts can be cold or hot, and even retain water, like Antarctica or the Sahara on Earth, but desert planets are planet wide arid.
Mars is a prominent example of a (cold) desert planet with a tenuous atmosphere.
But also other arid planets with atmospheres more as well as less dense have been identified as desert planets, like Venus and Mercury.

History
A 2011 study suggested that not only are life-sustaining desert planets possible, but that they might be more common than Earth-like planets.  The study found that, when modeled, desert planets had a much larger habitable zone than ocean planets.  The same study also speculated that Venus may have once been a habitable desert planet as recently as 1 billion years ago.  It is also predicted that Earth will become a desert planet within a billion years due to the Sun's increasing luminosity. 
A study conducted in 2013 concluded that hot desert planets without runaway greenhouse effect can exist in 0.5 AU around Sun-like stars. In that study, it was concluded that a minimum humidity of 1% is needed to wash off carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, but too much water can act as a greenhouse gas itself. Higher atmospheric pressures increase the range in which the water can remain liquid.

Science fiction
The concept has become a common setting in science fiction, appearing as early as the 1956 film Forbidden Planet and Frank Herbert's 1965 novel Dune. The environment of the desert planet Arrakis (also known as Dune) in the Dune franchise drew inspiration from the Middle East, particularly the Arabian Peninsula and Persian Gulf, as well as Mexico. Dune in turn inspired the desert planets which prominently appear in the Star Wars franchise, including the planets Tatooine, Geonosis, and Jakku.

Mountain research,"Mountain research, traditionally also known as orology (from Greek oros ὄρος for 'mountain' and logos λόγος), is a field of research that regionally concentrates on the Earth's surface's part covered by mountain environments.

Mountain areas
Different approaches have been developed to define mountainous areas. While some use an altitudinal difference of 300 m inside an area to define that zone as mountainous, others consider differences from 1000 m or more, depending on the areas' latitude. Additionally, some include steepness to define mountain regions, hence excluding high plateaus (e.g. the Andean Altiplano or the Tibetan Plateau), zones often seen to be mountainous. A more pragmatic but useful definition has been proposed by the Italian Statistics Office ISTAT, which classifies municipalities as mountainous

if at least 80% of their territory is situated above ≥ 600 m above sea level, and/or
if they have an altitudinal difference of 600 m (or more) within their administrative boundaries.
The United Nations Environmental Programme has produced a map of mountain areas worldwide using a combination of criteria, including regions with

elevations from 300 to 1000 m and local elevation range > 300 m;
elevations from 1000 to 1500 m and slope ≥ 5° or local elevation range > 300 m;
elevations from 1500 to 2500 m and slope ≥ 2°;
elevations of 2500 m or more.

Focus
Broader definition
In a broader sense, mountain research is considered any research in mountain regions: for instance disciplinary studies on Himalayan plants, Andean rocks, Alpine cities, or Carpathian people. It is comparable to research that concentrates on the Arctic and Antarctic (polar research) or coasts (coastal research).

Narrower definition
In a narrower sense, mountain research focuses on mountain regions, their description and the explanation of the human-environment interaction in (positive) and the sustainable development of (normative) these areas. So-defined mountain research is situated at the nexus of natural sciences, social sciences and humanities. Drawing on Alexander von Humboldt's work in the Andean realm, mountain geography and ecology are considered core areas of study; nevertheless important contributions are coming from anthropology, geology, economics, history or spatial planning. 
One definition of mountain science was given by the Romanian professor Radu Rey in 1985 in the book ""Mountain Civilization"", as follows:

Mountain science can be defined as representing the study of socio-economic, human, technical and technological phenomena regarding man-nature relationships in mountain systems (specific to mountainous regions), aiming at the conceptualization and promotion of ways (methods, techniques, variants) of their optimized development. It integrates knowledge (disciplines) from fields such as agriculture, animal husbandry, human ecology, geoecology and pedology, biology, demography and ethnography, human and animal psychology, architecture, construction and building materials, elements of forestry and geology, beekeeping, fish farming, economics, the organization and operation of the private mountain household, as well as other specific systems, mountain systematization, mountain design, specific ergonomics, small/large industries and crafts, tourism and agro-tourism, hygienic-sanitary education, material natural resources (minerals, plants, animals) and energy (unconventional), legislation and legal relations, specifically mountain, human resources - tradition and culture.
In sum, a narrowly defined mountain research applies an interdisciplinary and integrative regional approach. Slaymaker summarizes:

The science of montology [...] starts with recognition of the importance of verticality, a distinctive feature of mountain regions, which imposes vertical control of the production system; marginality, which results from low agricultural potential; centrality of mechanisms of power and violence; population growth and expansion; and religion and myth, expressed in mountains as sacred places. Montology emphasises restoration ecology to include re-vegetation, rehabilitation, reclamation and recovery of the lost landscape form and function [...]. Landscape ecological effects are arranged along altitudinal belts and form the basis for a more comprehensive understanding of critical habitats for conservation and development. This approach has an underlying assumption of climax communities each fitting into a narrow altitudinal band.

Denomination
Mountain research or orology—not to be confused with orography—, is sometimes denominated mountology. This term stems from Carl Troll's mountain geoecology—geoecology being Troll's English translation of the German Landschaftsökologie—and appeared at a meeting in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1977. Since then, scholars such as Jack D. Ives, Bruno Messerli and Robert E. Rhoades have claimed the development of mountology as interdisciplinary mountain research.

Pope's Folly Island,"Pope's Folly Island (also called Harris' Island, Green Island or Mark Island) is a small 2 acres (0.81 ha) island located 0.2 miles (0.32 km) from the Canadian Campobello Island, but has been historically disputed whether it belongs to Canada or the United States.
It has strategic value as it controls the entry to the channel, yet Canadian admiralty charts originally ceded it to the Americans, while US hydrographic charts ceded it to Canada.
As of 1910, the island has been part of the United States. There is a geodetic triangulation station on a rocky ledge on the north end.

History
Zibah Pope lived in Eastport, Maine working as a smuggler before moving to Saint George, New Brunswick while establishing a ""trading post"" on the island in 1812, taking advantage of the fact the international border ran through the center of it, where he built a storehouse - before losing a fortune and becoming a preacher. In 1823, the island's peculiar legal nature became the crucial point of two smuggling cases. A more romantic telling says that Pope was a woman-hating bachelor who retired to the island to avoid women, until the day came that he found himself having to save the life of a drowning widow.
In 1898, the US appointed Mr. Mendenhall and Great Britain appointed Mr. King, to locate the 1842 cast iron columns set in swamps near Amity, Maine and Richmond, New Brunswick that officially marked the boundary of the Treaty of Washington and determine on which side of a line between them Pope's Folly would lay.
In 1903, embers from a fire at the Lubec Sardine Company ignited the brush on Pope's Folly and devastated its trees. In 1909, Captain Young's schooner Rebecca went aground on Pope's Folly by error, and required towing.
President William Taft visited the area in 1911, stopping to view the island whose jurisdiction had been granted to the US, but did not visit the island. However a moose at that time swam ashore on the island, causing surprise.

City network,"City networks can either refer to a membership organization city leaders join to connect their city to other municipalities, or to a geographical concept used to describe inter-connectivity of cities on different levels (trade, railways, culture etc.).

City networks in international cooperation
In the perspective of international cooperation, the term ""city network"" refers to a membership organization that cities join either to take part to specific projects, to be represented by geographical specificity, or to assert political commitments. One of the main reasons why cities join a city network is to learn good practices from peer cities that have similar characteristics and face comparable challenges (infrastructure, urban transport, water and sanitation, smart city, etc.).

City networks as a geographical concept
City networks are a geographical concept studying connections between cities by placing the cities as nodes on a network. In modern conceptions of cities, these networks play an important role in understanding the nature of cities. City networks can identify physical connections to other places, such as railways, canals, scheduled flights, or telecommunication networks, typically done using graph theory. City networks also exist in immaterial form, such as trade, global finance, markets, migration, cultural links, shared social spaces or shared histories. There are also networks of religious nature, in particular through pilgrimage.
The city itself is then regarded as the node where different networks run together. Some urban thinkers have argued that cities can only be understood if the context of the city's connections is understood.
It has been argued that city networks are a key ingredient of what defines a city, along with the number of people (density) and the particular way of life in cities.

Mountain chain,"A mountain chain is a row of high mountain summits, a linear sequence of interconnected or related mountains, or a contiguous ridge of mountains within a larger mountain range. The term is also used for elongated fold mountains with several parallel chains (""chain mountains"").
While in mountain ranges, the term mountain chain is common, in hill ranges a sequence of hills tends to be referred to a ridge or hill chain.
Elongated mountain chains occur most frequently in the orogeny of fold mountains, (that are folded by lateral pressure), and nappe belts (where a sheetlike body of rock has been pushed over another rock mass). Other types of range such as horst ranges, fault block mountain or truncated uplands rarely form parallel mountain chains. However, if a truncated upland is eroded into a high table land, the incision of valleys can lead to the formations of mountain or hill chains.

Formation of parallel mountain chains
The chain-like arrangement of summits and the formation of long, jagged mountain crests – known in Spanish as sierras (""saws"") – is a consequence of their collective formation by mountain building forces. The often linear structure is linked to the direction of these thrust forces and the resulting mountain folding which in turn relates to the fault lines in the upper part of the Earth's crust, that run between the individual mountain chains. In these fault zones, the rock, which has sometimes been pulverised, is easily eroded, so that large river valleys are carved out. These, so called longitudinal valleys reinforce the trend, during the early mountain building phase, towards the formation of parallel chains of mountains.
The tendency, especially of fold mountains (e. g. the Cordilleras) to produce roughly parallel chains is due to their rock structure and the propulsive forces of plate tectonics. The uplifted rock masses are either magmatic plutonic rocks, easily shaped because of their higher temperature, or sediments or metamorphic rocks, which have a less robust structure, that are deposited in the synclines. As a result of orogenic movements, strata of folded rock are formed that are crumpled out of their original horizontal plane and thrust against one another. The longitudinal stretching of the folds takes place at right angles to the direction of the lateral thrusting. The overthrust folds of a nappe belt (e.g. the Central Alps) are formed in a similar way.
Although the fold mountains, chain mountains and nappe belts around the world were formed at different times in the Earth's history, all during their initial mountain building phases, they are nevertheless morphologically similar. Harder rock forms continuous arêtes or ridges that follow the strike of the beds and folds. The mountain chains or ridges therefore run approximately parallel to one another. They are only interrupted by short, usually narrow, transverse valleys, which often form water gaps. During the course of Earth history, erosion by water, ice and wind carried away the highest points of the mountain crests and carved out individual summits or summit chains. Between them, notches were formed that, depending on altitude and rock-type, form knife-edged cols or gentler mountain passes and saddles.

Dominant rocks and mountain forms
Nappe or fold mountains, with their roughly parallel mountain chains, generally have a common geological age, but may consist of various types of rock. For example, in the Central Alps, granitic rocks, gneisses and metamorphic slate are found, while to the north and south, are the Limestone Alps. The Northern Limestone Alps are, in turn, followed by soft flysch mountains and the molasse zone. 
The type of rock influences the appearance of the mountain ranges very markedly, because erosion leads to very different topography depending on the hardness of the rock and its petrological structure. In addition to height and climate, other factors are the layering of the rock, its gradient and aspect, the types of waterbody and the lines of dislocation. For hard rock massifs, rugged rock faces (e.g. in the Dolomites) and mighty scree slopes are typical. By contrast, flysch or slate forms gentler mountain shapes and kuppen or domed mountaintops, because the rock is not porous, but easily shaped.

Cabinet painting,"A cabinet painting (or cabinet picture) is a small painting, typically no larger than two feet (0.61 meters) in either dimension, but often much smaller. The term is especially used for paintings that show full-length figures or landscapes at a small scale, rather than a head or other object painted nearly life-size. Such paintings are done very precisely, with a great degree of ""finish"".
From the fifteenth century onward, wealthy collectors of art would keep these paintings in a cabinet, which was a relatively small and private room (often very small even in large houses) to which only those with whom they were on especially intimate terms would be admitted. A cabinet, also known as a closet, study (from the Italian studiolo), office, or by other names, might be used as an office or just a sitting room. Heating the main rooms in large palaces or mansions in the winter was difficult, so small rooms such as cabinets were more comfortable. They offered more privacy from servants or other household members and visitors. Typically, a cabinet would be for the use of a single individual; a large house might have at least two (his and hers) and often more.

Later, cabinet paintings might be housed in a display case, also known as a cabinet, but the term cabinet arose from the name (originally in Italian) of the room, not the piece of furniture. Other small and precious objects, including miniature paintings, ""curiosities"" of all sorts (see cabinet of curiosities), old master prints, books, or small sculptures might also be displayed in the room.
A rare example of a surviving cabinet with its contents probably little changed since the early eighteenth century is at Ham House in Richmond, London. It is less than ten feet square, and leads off from the Long Gallery which is over a hundred feet long and twenty feet wide, giving a rather startling change in scale and atmosphere. As is often the case, it has a view of the front entrance to the house, so that passersby and daily activities can be observed. Most surviving large houses or palaces, especially from before 1700, have such rooms, but they are often not displayed or accessible to visitors.
The magnificent Mannerist Studiolo of Francesco I Medici in Florence is larger than most examples and rather atypical in that most of the paintings were commissioned for the room.
There is an equivalent type of small sculpture, usually bronzes. The leading exponent in the late Renaissance was Giambologna, who produced sizeable editions of reduced versions of his large works, and also made many exclusively in small scale. These sculptures were designed to be picked up and handled, even fondled. Small antiquities were also very commonly displayed in such rooms, including rare coinage.

 
Small paintings have been produced during all periods of Western art, but some periods and artists are especially noticeable for them. Raphael produced many cabinet paintings, and all the paintings of the important German artist Adam Elsheimer (1578–1610) could be so described. The works of these two were much copied. The Dutch artists of the seventeenth century had an enormous output of small paintings. The painters of the Leiden School were especially noted ""Fijnschilders"" or ""fine painters"" producing highly finished small works. Watteau, Fragonard and other French 18th-century artists produced many small works, generally emphasizing spirit and atmosphere rather than a detailed finish. In modern times the term is not as common as it was in the 19th century, but remains in use among art historians.
A ""cabinet miniature"" is a larger portrait miniature, usually full-length and typically up to about ten inches (25 cm) high. These were first painted in England, from the end of the 1580s, initially by Nicholas Hilliard and Isaac Oliver.
In 1991, an exhibition entitled ""Cabinet Painting"" toured London, Hove Museum and Art Gallery and Glynn Vivian Art Gallery and Museum, Swansea. It included more than sixty cabinet paintings by contemporary artists.

High water mark,"A high water mark is a point that represents the maximum rise of a body of water over land. Such a mark is often the result of a flood, but high water marks may reflect an all-time high, an annual high (highest level to which water rose that year) or the high point for some other division of time. Knowledge of the high water mark for an area is useful in managing the development of that area, particularly in making preparations for flood surges. High water marks from floods have been measured for planning purposes since at least as far back as the civilizations of ancient Egypt. It is a common practice to create a physical marker indicating one or more of the highest water marks for an area, usually with a line at the level to which the water rose, and a notation of the date on which this high water mark was set. This may be a free-standing flood level sign or other marker, or it may be affixed to a building or other structure that was standing at the time of the flood that set the mark.
A high water mark is not necessarily an actual physical mark, but it is possible for water rising to a high point to leave a lasting physical impression such as floodwater staining. A landscape marking left by the high water mark of ordinary tidal action may be called a strandline and is typically composed of debris left by high tide. The area at the top of a beach where debris is deposited is an example of this phenomenon. Where there are tides, this line is formed by the highest position of the tide, and moves up and down the beach on a fortnightly cycle. The debris is chiefly composed of rotting seaweed, but can also include a large amount of litter, either from ships at sea or from sewage outflows.

Ecological significance
The strandline is an important habitat for a variety of animals. In parts of the United Kingdom, sandhoppers such as Talitrus saltator and the seaweed fly Coelopa frigida are abundant in the rotting seaweed, and these invertebrates provide food for shore birds such as the rock pipit, turnstone and pied wagtail, and mammals such as brown hares, foxes, voles and mice.

Legal significance
One kind of high water mark is the ordinary high water mark or average high water mark, the high water mark that can be expected to be produced by a body of water in non-flood conditions. The ordinary high water mark may have legal significance and is often being used to demarcate property boundaries. The ordinary high water mark has also been used for other legal demarcations. For example, a 1651 analysis of laws passed by the English Parliament notes that for persons granted the title Admiral of the English Seas, ""the Admirals power extended even to the high water mark, and into the main streams"".
In the United States, the high water mark is also significant because the United States Constitution gives Congress the authority to legislate for waterways, and the high water mark is used to determine the geographic extent of that authority. Federal regulations (33 CFR 328.3(e)) define the ""ordinary high water mark"" (OHWM) as ""that line on the shore established by the fluctuations of water and indicated by physical characteristics such as a clear, natural line impressed on the bank, shelving, changes in the character of soil, destruction of terrestrial vegetation, the presence of litter and debris, or other appropriate means that consider the characteristics of the surrounding areas. For the purposes of Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, the OHWM defines the lateral limits of federal jurisdiction over non-tidal water bodies in the absence of adjacent wetlands. For the purposes of Sections 9 and 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, the OHWM defines the lateral limits of federal jurisdiction over traditional navigable waters of the US. The OHWM is used by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, and other federal agencies to determine the geographical extent of their regulatory programs. Likewise, many states use similar definitions of the OHWM for the purposes of their own regulatory programs.
In 2016, the Court of Appeals of Indiana ruled that land below the OHWM (as defined by common law) along Lake Michigan is held by the state in trust for public use.

Artificial intelligence content detection,"Artificial intelligence detection software aims to determine whether some content (text, image, video or audio) was generated using artificial intelligence (AI). However, this software is often unreliable.

Accuracy issues
Many AI detection tools have been shown to be unreliable when generating AI-generated text. In a 2023 study conducted by Weber-Wulff et al., researchers evaluated 14 detection tools including Turnitin and GPTZero and found that ""all scored below 80% of accuracy and only 5 over 70%."" They also found that these tools tend to have a bias for classifying texts more as human than as AI, and that accuracy of these tools worsens upon paraphrasing.

False positives
In AI content detection, a false positive is when human-written work is incorrectly flagged as AI-written. Many AI detection platforms claim to have a minimal level of false positives, with Turnitin claiming a less than 1% false positive rate. However, later research by The Washington Post produced much higher rates of 50%, though they used a smaller sample size. False positives in an academic setting frequently lead to accusations of academic misconduct, which can have serious consequences for a student's academic record. Additionally, studies have shown evidence that many AI detection models are prone to give false positives to work written by those whose first language isn't English and neurodiverse people.
In June 2023, Janelle Shane wrote that portions of her book You Look Like a Thing and I Love You were flagged as AI-generated.

False negatives
A false negative is a failure to identify documents with AI-written text. False negatives often happen as a result of a detection software's sensitivity level or because evasive techniques were used when generating the work to make it sound more human. False negatives are less of a concern academically, since they aren't likely to lead to accusations and ramifications. Notably, Turnitin stated they have a 15% false negative rate.

Text detection
For text, this is usually done to prevent alleged plagiarism, often by detecting repetition of words as telltale signs that a text was AI-generated (including hallucinations). They are often used by teachers marking their students, usually on an ad hoc basis. Following the release of ChatGPT and similar AI text generative software, many educational establishments have issued policies against the use of AI by students. AI text detection software is also used by those assessing job applicants, as well as online search engines.
Current detectors may sometimes be unreliable and have incorrectly marked work by humans as originating from AI while failing to detect AI-generated work in other instances. MIT Technology Review said that the technology ""struggled to pick up ChatGPT-generated text that had been slightly rearranged by humans and obfuscated by a paraphrasing tool"". AI text detection software has also been shown to discriminate against non-native speakers of English.
Two students from the University of California, Davis, were referred to the university's Office of Student Success and Judicial Affairs (OSSJA) after their professors scanned their essays with positive results; the first with an AI detector called GPTZero, and the second with an AI detector integration in Turnitin. However, following media coverage, and a thorough investigation, the students were cleared of any wrongdoing.
In April 2023, Cambridge University and other members of the Russell Group of universities in the United Kingdom opted out of Turnitin's AI text detection tool, after expressing concerns it was unreliable. The University of Texas at Austin opted out of the system six months later.
In May 2023, a professor at Texas A&M University–Commerce used ChatGPT to detect whether his students' content was written by it, which ChatGPT said was the case. As such, he threatened to fail the class despite ChatGPT not being able to detect AI-generated writing. No students were prevented from graduating because of the issue, and all but one student (who admitted to using the software) were exonerated from accusations of having used ChatGPT in their content.
In July 2023, a paper titled ""GPT detectors are biased against non-native English writers"" was released, reporting that GPTs discriminate against non-native English authors. The paper compared seven GPT detectors against essays from both non-native English speakers and essays from United States students. The essays from non-native English speakers had an average false positive rate of 61.3%.
An article by Thomas Germain, published on Gizmodo in June 2024, reported job losses among freelance writers and journalists due to AI text detection software mistakenly classifying their work as AI-generated.
In September 2024, Common Sense Media reported that generative AI detectors had a 20% false positive rate for Black students, compared to 10% of Latino students and 7% of White students.

Netflix Animation,"Netflix Animation (also known as Netflix Animation Studios) is an American animation studio and a subsidiary of Netflix, Inc. It was founded in March 2018 and based in Los Angeles, California. The studio is best known for producing and developing animated television programs and animated feature films which are all hosted on the Netflix streaming service.

History
When Netflix began to produce original animated content in 2013, all of them were produced by third-party companies, mostly DreamWorks Animation Television. However, in November 2018, it was announced that Netflix was developing original animated projects in-house including Klaus and Kid Cosmic.  In 2019, Netflix Animation expanded operations and leased offices in Burbank and Hollywood for animation, television and film production.
The company acquired Australian animation/visual effects studio Animal Logic in July 2022. The same month, Melissa Cobb stepped down as vice president of film animation whilst still on board as producer with Karen Toliver as her replacement.
In June 2024, Hannah Minghella was named head of feature animation and live-action family film at Netflix, replacing Karen Toliver.

Desert climate,"The desert climate or arid climate (in the Köppen climate classification BWh and BWk) is a dry climate sub-type in which there is a severe excess of evaporation over precipitation. The typically bald, rocky, or sandy surfaces in desert climates are dry and hold little moisture, quickly evaporating the already little rainfall they receive. Covering 14.2% of Earth's land area, hot deserts are the second-most common type of climate on Earth after the Polar climate.
There are two variations of a desert climate according to the Köppen climate classification: a hot desert climate (BWh), and a cold desert climate (BWk). To delineate ""hot desert climates"" from ""cold desert climates"", a mean annual temperature of 18 °C (64.4 °F) is used as an isotherm so that a location with a BW type climate with the appropriate temperature above this isotherm is classified as ""hot arid subtype"" (BWh), and a location with the appropriate temperature below the isotherm is classified as ""cold arid subtype"" (BWk).
Most desert/arid climates receive between 25 and 200 mm (1 and 8 in) of rainfall annually, although some of the most consistently hot areas of Central Australia, the Sahel and Guajira Peninsula can be, due to extreme potential evapotranspiration, classed as arid with the annual rainfall as high as 430 millimetres or 17 inches.

Precipitation
Although no part of Earth is known for certain to be rainless, in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile, the average annual rainfall over 17 years was only 5 millimetres (0.20 in). Some locations in the Sahara Desert such as Kufra, Libya, record an even drier 0.86 mm (0.034 in) of rainfall annually. The official weather station in Death Valley, United States reports 60 mm (2.4 in) annually, but in 40 months between 1931 and 1934 a total of just 16 mm (0.63 in) of rainfall was measured.
To determine whether a location has an arid climate, the precipitation threshold is determined. The precipitation threshold (in millimetres) involves first multiplying the average annual temperature in °C by 20, then adding 280 if 70% or more of the total precipitation is in the high-sun summer half of the year (April through September in the Northern Hemisphere, or October through March in the Southern), or 140 if 30–70% of the total precipitation is received during the applicable period, or 0 if less than 30% of the total precipitation is so received there. If the area's annual precipitation is less than half the threshold (50%), it is classified as a BW (desert climate), while 50–100% of the threshold results in a semi-arid climate.

Hot desert climates
Hot desert climates (BWh) are typically found under the subtropical ridge in the lower middle latitudes or the subtropics, often between 20° and 33° north and south latitudes. In these locations, stable descending air and high pressure aloft clear clouds and create hot, arid conditions with intense sunshine. Hot desert climates are found across vast areas of North Africa, West Asia, northwestern parts of the Indian Subcontinent, southwestern Africa, interior Australia, the Southwestern United States, northern Mexico, sections of southeastern Spain, the coast of Peru and Chile and parts of the Brazilian sertão. This makes hot deserts present in every continent except Antarctica.
At the time of high sun (summer), scorching, desiccating heat prevails. Hot-month average temperatures are normally between 29 and 35 °C (84 and 95 °F), and midday readings of 43–46 °C (109–115 °F) are common. The world's absolute heat records, over 50 °C (122 °F), are generally in the hot deserts, where the heat potential can be the highest on the planet. This includes the record of 56.7 °C (134.1 °F) in Death Valley, which is currently considered the highest temperature recorded on Earth. Some deserts in the tropics consistently experience very high temperatures all year long, even during wintertime. These locations feature some of the highest annual average temperatures recorded on Earth, exceeding 30 °C (86 °F), up to nearly 35 °C (95 °F) in Dallol, Ethiopia. This last feature is seen in sections of Africa and Arabia. During colder periods of the year, night-time temperatures can drop to freezing or below due to the exceptional radiation loss under the clear skies. However, temperatures rarely drop far below freezing under the hot subtype.

Hot desert climates can be found in the deserts of North Africa such as the wide Sahara Desert, the Libyan Desert or the Nubian Desert; deserts of the Horn of Africa such as the Danakil Desert or the Grand Bara Desert; deserts of Southern Africa such as the Namib Desert or the Kalahari Desert; deserts of West Asia such as the Arabian Desert, or the Syrian Desert; deserts of South Asia such as Dasht-e Lut and Dasht-e Kavir of Iran or the Thar Desert of India and Pakistan; deserts of the United States and Mexico such as the Mojave Desert, the Sonoran Desert or the Chihuahuan Desert; deserts of Australia such as the Simpson Desert or the Great ",Deserts,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_climate,1,desert climate arid climate köppen climate classification bwh bwk dry climate subtype severe excess evaporation precipitation typically bald rocky sandy surface desert climate dry hold little moisture quickly evaporating already little rainfall receive covering earth land area hot desert secondmost common type climate earth polar climate two variation desert climate according köppen climate classification hot desert climate bwh cold desert climate bwk delineate hot desert climate cold desert climate mean annual temperature °c °f used isotherm location bw type climate appropriate temperature isotherm classified hot arid subtype bwh location appropriate temperature isotherm classified cold arid subtype bwk desertarid climate receive mm rainfall annually although consistently hot area central australia sahel guajira peninsula due extreme potential evapotranspiration classed arid annual rainfall high millimetre inch precipitation although part earth known certain rainless atacama desert northern chile average annual rainfall year millimetre location sahara desert kufra libya record even drier mm rainfall annually official weather station death valley united state report mm annually month total mm rainfall measured determine whether location arid climate precipitation threshold determined precipitation threshold millimetre involves first multiplying average annual temperature °c adding total precipitation highsun summer half year april september northern hemisphere october march southern – total precipitation received applicable period less total precipitation received area annual precipitation less half threshold classified bw desert climate – threshold result semiarid climate hot desert climate hot desert climate bwh typically found subtropical ridge lower middle latitude subtropics often ° ° north south latitude location stable descending air high pressure aloft clear cloud create hot arid condition intense sunshine hot desert climate found across vast area north africa west asia northwestern part indian subcontinent southwestern africa interior australia southwestern united state northern mexico section southeastern spain coast peru chile part brazilian sertão make hot desert present every continent except antarctica time high sun summer scorching desiccating heat prevails hotmonth average temperature normally °c °f midday reading – °c – °f common world absolute heat record °c °f generally hot desert heat potential highest planet includes record °c °f death valley currently considered highest temperature recorded earth desert tropic consistently experience high temperature year long even wintertime location feature highest annual average temperature recorded earth exceeding °c °f nearly °c °f dallol ethiopia last feature seen section africa arabia colder period year nighttime temperature drop freezing due exceptional radiation loss clear sky however temperature rarely drop far freezing hot subtype hot desert climate found desert north africa wide sahara desert libyan desert nubian desert desert horn africa danakil desert grand bara desert desert southern africa namib desert kalahari desert desert west asia arabian desert syrian desert desert south asia dashte lut dashte kavir iran thar desert india pakistan desert united state mexico mojave desert sonoran desert chihuahuan desert desert australia simpson desert great
Allusion,"Allusion, or alluding, is a figure of speech that makes a reference to someone or something by name (a person, object, location, etc.) without explaining how it relates to the given context, so that the audience must realize the connection in their own minds. When a connection is directly and explicitly explained (as opposed to indirectly implied), it is instead often simply termed a reference. In the arts, a literary allusion puts the alluded text in a new context under which it assumes new meanings and denotations. Literary allusion is closely related to parody and pastiche, which are also ""text-linking"" literary devices.
In a wider, more informal context, an allusion is a passing or casually short statement indicating broader meaning. It is an incidental mention of something, either directly or by implication, such as ""In the stock market, he met his Waterloo.""

Scope of the term
In the most traditional sense, allusion is a literary term, though the word has also come to encompass indirect references to any source, including allusions in film or the visual arts. In literature, allusions are used to link concepts that the reader already has knowledge of, with concepts discussed in the story. It is not possible to predetermine the nature of all the new meanings and inter-textual patterns that an allusion will generate. In the field of film criticism, a filmmaker's intentionally unspoken visual reference to another film is also called an homage. It may even be sensed that real events have allusive overtones, when a previous event is inescapably recalled by a current one. ""Allusion is bound up with a vital and perennial topic in literary theory, the place of authorial intention in interpretation"", William Irwin observed, in asking ""What is an allusion?""
Without the hearer or reader comprehending the author's intention, an allusion becomes merely a decorative device. Allusion is an economical device, a figure of speech that uses a relatively short space to draw upon the ready stock of ideas, cultural memes or emotion already associated with a topic. Thus, an allusion is understandable only to those with prior knowledge of the covert reference in question, a mark of their cultural literacy.

Allusion as cultural bond
The origin of allusion is from the Latin noun allusionem ""a playing with, a reference to"", from alludere ""to play, jest, make fun of"", a compound of ad ""to"" + ludere ""to play"". Recognizing the point of allusion's condensed riddle also reinforces cultural solidarity between the maker of the allusion and the hearer: their shared familiarity with allusion bonds them. Ted Cohen finds such a ""cultivation of intimacy"" to be an essential element of many jokes. Some aspect of the referent must be invoked and identified for the tacit association to be made; the allusion is indirect in part because ""it depends on something more than mere substitution of a referent"".
The allusion depends as well on the author's intent; a reader may search out parallels to a figure of speech or a passage, of which the author was unaware, and offer them as unconscious allusions—coincidences that a critic might not find illuminating. Addressing such issues is an aspect of hermeneutics.
William Irwin remarks that allusion moves in only one direction: ""If A alludes to B, then B does not allude to A. The Bible does not allude to Shakespeare, though Shakespeare may allude to the Bible."" Irwin appends a note: ""Only a divine author, outside of time, would seem capable of alluding to a later text.""  This is the basis for Christian readings of Old Testament prophecy, which asserts that passages are to be read as allusions to future events.
Allusion differs from the similar term intertextuality in that it is an intentional effort on the author's part. The success of an allusion depends in part on at least some of its audience ""getting"" it. Allusions may be made increasingly obscure, until at last they are understood by the author alone, who thereby retreats into a private language.

Academic analysis of the concept of allusions
In discussing the richly allusive poetry of Virgil's Georgics, R. F. Thomas distinguished six categories of allusive reference, which are applicable to a wider cultural sphere. These types are:

 Casual reference, ""the use of language which recalls a specific antecedent, but only in a general sense"" that is relatively unimportant to the new context;
 Single reference, in which the hearer or reader is intended to ""recall the context of the model and apply that context to the new situation""; such a specific single reference in Virgil, according to Thomas, is a means of ""making connections or conveying ideas on a level of intense subtlety"";
 Self-reference, where the locus is in the poet's own work;
 Corrective allusion, where the imitation is clearly in opposition to the original source's intentions;
 Apparent reference ""which seems clearly to recall a specific model but which on closer inspection frustrates that i",Literature,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allusion,0,allusion alluding figure speech make reference someone something name person object location etc without explaining relates given context audience must realize connection mind connection directly explicitly explained opposed indirectly implied instead often simply termed reference art literary allusion put alluded text new context assumes new meaning denotation literary allusion closely related parody pastiche also textlinking literary device wider informal context allusion passing casually short statement indicating broader meaning incidental mention something either directly implication stock market met waterloo scope term traditional sense allusion literary term though word also come encompass indirect reference source including allusion film visual art literature allusion used link concept reader already knowledge concept discussed story possible predetermine nature new meaning intertextual pattern allusion generate field film criticism filmmaker intentionally unspoken visual reference another film also called homage may even sensed real event allusive overtone previous event inescapably recalled current one allusion bound vital perennial topic literary theory place authorial intention interpretation william irwin observed asking allusion without hearer reader comprehending author intention allusion becomes merely decorative device allusion economical device figure speech us relatively short space draw upon ready stock idea cultural meme emotion already associated topic thus allusion understandable prior knowledge covert reference question mark cultural literacy allusion cultural bond origin allusion latin noun allusionem playing reference alludere play jest make fun compound ad ludere play recognizing point allusion condensed riddle also reinforces cultural solidarity maker allusion hearer shared familiarity allusion bond ted cohen find cultivation intimacy essential element many joke aspect referent must invoked identified tacit association made allusion indirect part depends something mere substitution referent allusion depends well author intent reader may search parallel figure speech passage author unaware offer unconscious allusions—coincidences critic might find illuminating addressing issue aspect hermeneutics william irwin remark allusion move one direction alludes b b allude bible allude shakespeare though shakespeare may allude bible irwin appends note divine author outside time would seem capable alluding later text basis christian reading old testament prophecy asserts passage read allusion future event allusion differs similar term intertextuality intentional effort author part success allusion depends part least audience getting allusion may made increasingly obscure last understood author alone thereby retreat private language academic analysis concept allusion discussing richly allusive poetry virgil georgics r f thomas distinguished six category allusive reference applicable wider cultural sphere type casual reference use language recall specific antecedent general sense relatively unimportant new context single reference hearer reader intended recall context model apply context new situation specific single reference virgil according thomas mean making connection conveying idea level intense subtlety selfreference locus poet work corrective allusion imitation clearly opposition original source intention apparent reference seems clearly recall specific model closer inspection frustrates
Blackwater river,"A blackwater river is a type of river with a slow-moving channel flowing through forested swamps or wetlands. Most major blackwater rivers are in the Amazon Basin and the Southern United States. The term is used in fluvial studies, geology, geography, ecology, and biology.  Not all dark rivers are blackwater in that technical sense. Some rivers in temperate regions, which drain or flow through areas of dark black loam, are simply black due to the color of the soil; these rivers are black mud rivers. There are also black mud estuaries.
Blackwater rivers are lower in nutrients than whitewater rivers and have ionic concentrations higher than rainwater. The unique conditions lead to flora and fauna that differ from both whitewater and clearwater rivers. The classification of Amazonian rivers into black, clear, and whitewater was first proposed by Alfred Russel Wallace in 1853 based on water colour, but the types were more clearly defined by chemistry and physics by Harald Sioli from the 1950s to the 1980s. Although many Amazonian rivers fall clearly into one of these categories, others show a mix of characteristics and may vary depending on season and flood levels.

Comparison between white and black waters
Black and white waters differ significantly in their ionic composition, as shown in Table 1.  Black waters are more acidic, resulting in an aluminum concentration greater than that of the more neutral white waters.  The major difference is the concentrations of sodium, magnesium, calcium, and potassium; these are very low in black waters.  This has ecological implications. Some animals need more calcium than is available in blackwaters, so for example, snails, which need much calcium to build shells, are not abundant in blackwaters. The lack of dissolved ions in black waters results in a low conductivity, similar to that of rainwater.
Black and white waters differ in their planktonic fauna and flora. Tables 2 and 3 compare the number of planktonic animals caught in black and white water localities only a few meters apart. The black water was not as extreme an example as the Rio Negro system. However, it can be seen that the black water held greater numbers of rotifers but fewer crustaceans and mites. These crustaceans are important foods for larval fish. The zones where the two waters mix are attractive to ostracods and young fish. These mixing zones tend to have many animals. The abundance is shown in Table 3, which compares animals in 10 litres (2.2 imp gal; 2.6 US gal) of water.

Comparison between clear and black waters
Blackwater rivers resemble clearwater rivers in having a low conductivity and relatively low levels of dissolved solids, but clearwater rivers have water that often only is somewhat acidic (typical pH ~6.5) and very clear with a greenish color. The main Amazonian clearwater rivers have their source in the Brazilian Plateau (such as Tapajós, Tocantins, Xingu and some right tributaries of the Madeira), but some originate in the Guiana Shield (such as Nhamundá, Paru, and Araguari).

Downtown,"Downtown is a term primarily used in American and Canadian English to refer to a city's sometimes commercial, cultural and often the historical, political, and geographic heart.  It is often synonymous with its central business district (CBD). It may also be a center for shopping and entertainment. Downtowns typically contain a small percentage of a city's employment but are concentrated in services, including high-end services (office or white-collar jobs). Sometimes, smaller downtowns include lower population densities and nearby lower incomes than suburbs. It is often distinguished as a hub of public transit and culture.

History
Origins
The Oxford English Dictionary's first citation for ""down town"" or ""downtown"" dates to 1770, in reference to the center of Boston. Some have posited that the term ""downtown"" was coined in New York City, where it was in use by the 1830s to refer to the original settlement, or town, at the southern tip of the island of Manhattan. As the town of New York grew into a city, the only direction it could grow on the island was toward the north, proceeding upriver from the original settlement, the ""up"" and ""down"" terminology coming from the customary map design in which up was north and down was south. Thus, anything north of the original town became known as ""uptown"" (Upper Manhattan), and was generally a residential area, while the original town – which was also New York's only major center of business at the time – became known as ""downtown"" (Lower Manhattan).

During the late 19th century, the term was gradually adopted by cities across the United States to refer to the historical core of the city, which was most often the same as the commercial heart of the city. ""Uptown"" also spread, but to a much lesser extent. In both cases, though, the directionality of both words was lost, so that a Bostonian might refer to going ""downtown"", even though it was north of where they were. Downtown lay to the south in Detroit, but to the north in Cleveland, to the east in St. Louis, and to the west in Pittsburgh. In Boston, a resident pointed out in 1880, downtown was in the center of the city. Uptown was north of downtown in Cincinnati, but south of downtown in New Orleans and San Francisco.
Notably, ""downtown"" was not included in dictionaries as late as the 1880s. But by the early 1900s, ""downtown"" was clearly established as the proper term in American English for a city's central business district, although the word was virtually unknown in Britain and Western Europe, where expressions such as ""city centre"" (British English), ""el centro"" (Spanish), ""das Zentrum"" (German), etc are used. Even as late as the early part of the 20th century, English travel writers felt it necessary to explain to their readers what ""downtown"" meant.
Although American downtowns lacked legally-defined boundaries, and were often parts of several of the wards that most cities used as their basic functional district, locating the downtown area was not difficult, as it was the place where all the street railways and elevated railways converged, and – at least in most places – where the railroad terminals were. It was the location of the great department stores and hotels, as well as that of theaters, clubs, cabarets, and dance halls, and where skyscrapers were built once that technology was perfected. It was also frequently, at first, the only part of a city that was electrified. It was also the place where street congestion was the worst, a problem for which a solution was never really found.
But most of all, downtown was the place where the city did its business. Inside its small precincts, sometimes as small as several hundred acres, the majority of the trading, selling, and purchasing – retail and wholesale – in the entire area would take place. There were hubs of business in other places around the city and its environs, but the downtown area was the chief one, truly the central business district. And as more and more business was done downtown, those who had their homes there were gradually pushed out, selling their property and moving to quieter residential areas uptown.

Skyscrapers
The skyscraper would become the hallmark of the downtown area. Prior to the invention of the elevator – and later the high-speed elevator – buildings were limited in height to about six stories, which was a de facto limit set by the amount of stairs it was assumed that people would climb, but with the elevator, that limit was shattered, and buildings began to be constructed up to about sixteen stories. What limited them then was the thickness of the masonry needed at the base to hold the weight of the building above it. As the buildings got taller, the thickness of the masonry and the space needed for elevators did not allow for sufficient rentable space to make the building profitable. What shattered that restriction was the invention of first the iron- and then the steel frame building, in which the building's load was carried b",Cities,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown,1,downtown term primarily used american canadian english refer city sometimes commercial cultural often historical political geographic heart often synonymous central business district cbd may also center shopping entertainment downtown typically contain small percentage city employment concentrated service including highend service office whitecollar job sometimes smaller downtown include lower population density nearby lower income suburb often distinguished hub public transit culture history origin oxford english dictionary first citation town downtown date reference center boston posited term downtown coined new york city use refer original settlement town southern tip island manhattan town new york grew city direction could grow island toward north proceeding upriver original settlement terminology coming customary map design north south thus anything north original town became known uptown upper manhattan generally residential area original town – also new york major center business time – became known downtown lower manhattan late th century term gradually adopted city across united state refer historical core city often commercial heart city uptown also spread much lesser extent case though directionality word lost bostonian might refer going downtown even though north downtown lay south detroit north cleveland east st louis west pittsburgh boston resident pointed downtown center city uptown north downtown cincinnati south downtown new orleans san francisco notably downtown included dictionary late early downtown clearly established proper term american english city central business district although word virtually unknown britain western europe expression city centre british english el centro spanish da zentrum german etc used even late early part th century english travel writer felt necessary explain reader downtown meant although american downtown lacked legallydefined boundary often part several ward city used basic functional district locating downtown area difficult place street railway elevated railway converged – least place – railroad terminal location great department store hotel well theater club cabaret dance hall skyscraper built technology perfected also frequently first part city electrified also place street congestion worst problem solution never really found downtown place city business inside small precinct sometimes small several hundred acre majority trading selling purchasing – retail wholesale – entire area would take place hub business place around city environs downtown area chief one truly central business district business done downtown home gradually pushed selling property moving quieter residential area uptown skyscraper skyscraper would become hallmark downtown area prior invention elevator – later highspeed elevator – building limited height six story de facto limit set amount stair assumed people would climb elevator limit shattered building began constructed sixteen story limited thickness masonry needed base hold weight building building got taller thickness masonry space needed elevator allow sufficient rentable space make building profitable shattered restriction invention first iron steel frame building building load carried b
Rimrock,"Rimrock is the sheer rock wall at the upper edge of a plateau, canyon, or geological uplift. It may refer to either the rock formation or to the rock itself. Rimrock may be composed of almost any stone—basalt, gneiss, granite, sandstone, etc.—and is frequently layered. Many times it overlays a softer stone which erodes away underneath. American Indians in the West often used cavities found below rimrock to construct dwellings and granaries.

World Deserts Foundation,"World Deserts Foundation (Fondation Deserts du Monde) is an Algerian non-governmental and intergovernmental organization. Its headquarters are located in Ghardaia, Algeria. Its mission is to promote sustainable development of desert regions.
World Deserts Foundation is one of the organizations participating on a continuing basis as the observer in the United Nations Economic and Social Council.
The Foundation has been established in 2002. It has created by the Algerian politician and then Minister of Tourism, Cherif Rahmani, as means to receive a share of funds from United Nations Development Programme allocated to the project overseen by the Algerian Ministry of Culture, as well as to provide a government-friendly, but officially independent and non-government partner for the purpose of securing funding that is not meant to be allocated to public institutions. For that reason, the Foundation has been criticized as a tool to misuse development funds and exclude proper civil society organizations who are less supportive of the government or have less ties to the current administration.

Drainage basin,"A drainage basin is an area of land in which all flowing surface water converges to a single point, such as a river mouth, or flows into another body of water, such as a lake or ocean. A basin is separated from adjacent basins by a perimeter, the drainage divide, made up of a succession of elevated features, such as ridges and hills. A basin may consist of smaller basins that merge at river confluences, forming a hierarchical pattern.
Other terms for a drainage basin are catchment area, catchment basin, drainage area, river basin, water basin, and impluvium. In North America, they are commonly called a watershed, though in other English-speaking places, ""watershed"" is used only in its original sense, that of the drainage divide line.
A drainage basin's boundaries are determined by watershed delineation, a common task in environmental engineering and science. 
In a closed drainage basin, or endorheic basin, rather than flowing to the ocean, water converges toward the interior of the basin, known as a sink, which may be a permanent lake, a dry lake, or a point where surface water is lost underground.
Drainage basins are similar but not identical to hydrologic units, which are drainage areas delineated so as to nest into a multi-level hierarchical drainage system. Hydrologic units are defined to allow multiple inlets, outlets, or sinks. In a strict sense, all drainage basins are hydrologic units, but not all hydrologic units are drainage basins.

Major drainage basins of the world
Ocean basins
About 48.71% of the world's land drains to the Atlantic Ocean. In North America, surface water drains to the Atlantic via the Saint Lawrence River and Great Lakes basins, the Eastern Seaboard of the United States, the Canadian Maritimes, and most of Newfoundland and Labrador. Nearly all of South America east of the Andes also drains to the Atlantic, as does most of Western and Central Europe and the greatest portion of western Sub-Saharan Africa, as well as Western Sahara and part of Morocco. 
The two major Mediterranean Seas of the world also flow to the Atlantic. The Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico basin includes most of the U.S. interior between the Appalachian and Rocky Mountains, a small part of the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, eastern Central America, the islands of the Caribbean and the Gulf, and a small part of northern South America. The Mediterranean Sea basin, with the Black Sea, includes much of North Africa, east-central Africa (through the Nile River), Southern, Central, and Eastern Europe, Turkey, and the coastal areas of Israel, Lebanon, and Syria.
The Arctic Ocean drains most of Western Canada and Northern Canada east of the Continental Divide, northern Alaska and parts of North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, and Montana in the United States, the north shore of the Scandinavian Peninsula in Europe, central and northern Russia, and parts of Kazakhstan and Mongolia in Asia, which totals to about 17% of the world's land.
Just over 13% of the land in the world drains to the Pacific Ocean. Its basin includes much of China, eastern and southeastern Russia, Japan, the Korean Peninsula, most of Indochina, Indonesia and Malaysia, the Philippines, all of the Pacific Islands, the northeast coast of Australia, and Canada and the United States west of the Continental Divide (including most of Alaska), as well as western Central America and South America west of the Andes.
The Indian Ocean's drainage basin also comprises about 13% of Earth's land. It drains the eastern coast of Africa, the coasts of the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, the Indian subcontinent, Burma, and most parts of Australia.

Largest river basins
The five largest river basins (by area), from largest to smallest, are those of the Amazon (7 million km2), the Congo (4 million km2), the Nile (3.4 million km2), the Mississippi (3.22 million km2), and the Río de la Plata (3.17 million km2). The three rivers that drain the most water, from most to least, are the Amazon, Ganges, and Congo rivers.

Endorheic drainage basins
Endorheic basin are inland basins that do not drain to an ocean. Endorheic basins cover around 18% of the Earth's land. Some endorheic basins drain to an Endorheic lake or Inland sea. Many of these lakes are ephemeral or vary dramatically in size depending on climate and inflow. If water evaporates or infiltrates into the ground at its terminus, the area can go by several names, such playa, salt flat, dry lake, or alkali sink.  
The largest endorheic basins are in Central Asia, including the Caspian Sea, the Aral Sea, and numerous smaller lakes. Other endorheic regions include the Great Basin in the United States, much of the Sahara Desert, the drainage basin of the Okavango River (Kalahari Basin), highlands near the African Great Lakes, the interiors of Australia and the Arabian Peninsula, and parts in Mexico and the Andes. Some of these, such as the Great Basin, are not single drainage basins but collections of sepa",Rivers,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage_basin,1,drainage basin area land flowing surface water converges single point river mouth flow another body water lake ocean basin separated adjacent basin perimeter drainage divide made succession elevated feature ridge hill basin may consist smaller basin merge river confluence forming hierarchical pattern term drainage basin catchment area catchment basin drainage area river basin water basin impluvium north america commonly called watershed though englishspeaking place watershed used original sense drainage divide line drainage basin boundary determined watershed delineation common task environmental engineering science closed drainage basin endorheic basin rather flowing ocean water converges toward interior basin known sink may permanent lake dry lake point surface water lost underground drainage basin similar identical hydrologic unit drainage area delineated nest multilevel hierarchical drainage system hydrologic unit defined allow multiple inlet outlet sink strict sense drainage basin hydrologic unit hydrologic unit drainage basin major drainage basin world ocean basin world land drain atlantic ocean north america surface water drain atlantic via saint lawrence river great lake basin eastern seaboard united state canadian maritimes newfoundland labrador nearly south america east andes also drain atlantic western central europe greatest portion western subsaharan africa well western sahara part morocco two major mediterranean sea world also flow atlantic caribbean sea gulf mexico basin includes u interior appalachian rocky mountain small part canadian province alberta saskatchewan eastern central america island caribbean gulf small part northern south america mediterranean sea basin black sea includes much north africa eastcentral africa nile river southern central eastern europe turkey coastal area israel lebanon syria arctic ocean drain western canada northern canada east continental divide northern alaska part north dakota south dakota minnesota montana united state north shore scandinavian peninsula europe central northern russia part kazakhstan mongolia asia total world land land world drain pacific ocean basin includes much china eastern southeastern russia japan korean peninsula indochina indonesia malaysia philippine pacific island northeast coast australia canada united state west continental divide including alaska well western central america south america west andes indian ocean drainage basin also comprises earth land drain eastern coast africa coast red sea persian gulf indian subcontinent burma part australia largest river basin five largest river basin area largest smallest amazon million km congo million km nile million km mississippi million km río de la plata million km three river drain water least amazon ganges congo river endorheic drainage basin endorheic basin inland basin drain ocean endorheic basin cover around earth land endorheic basin drain endorheic lake inland sea many lake ephemeral vary dramatically size depending climate inflow water evaporates infiltrates ground terminus area go several name playa salt flat dry lake alkali sink largest endorheic basin central asia including caspian sea aral sea numerous smaller lake endorheic region include great basin united state much sahara desert drainage basin okavango river kalahari basin highland near african great lake interior australia arabian peninsula part mexico andes great basin single drainage basin collection sepa
Evolution of deserts,"A desert is a landscape where little precipitation occurs and, consequently, living conditions create unique biomes and ecosystems. The lack of vegetation exposes the unprotected surface of the ground to denudation. About one-third of the land surface of the Earth is arid or semi-arid. This includes much of the polar regions, where little precipitation occurs, and which are sometimes called polar deserts or ""cold deserts"". Deserts can be classified by the amount of precipitation that falls, by the temperature that prevails, by the causes of desertification or by their geographical location.
Deserts are formed by weathering processes as large variations in temperature between day and night strain the rocks, which consequently break in pieces. Although rain seldom occurs in deserts, there are occasional downpours that can result in flash floods. Rain falling on hot rocks can cause them to shatter, and the resulting fragments and rubble strewn over the desert floor are further eroded by the wind. This picks up particles of sand and dust, which can remain airborne for extended periods – sometimes causing the formation of sand storms or dust storms. Wind-blown sand grains striking any solid object in their path can abrade the surface. Rocks are smoothed down, and the wind sorts sand into uniform deposits. The grains end up as level sheets of sand or are piled high in billowing dunes. Other deserts are flat, stony plains where all the fine material has been blown away and the surface consists of a mosaic of smooth stones, often forming desert pavements, and little further erosion occurs. Other desert features include rock outcrops, exposed bedrock and clays once deposited by flowing water. Temporary lakes may form and salt pans may be left when waters evaporate. There may be underground water sources in the form of springs and seepages from aquifers. Where these are found, oases can occur.
Plants and animals living in the desert need special adaptations to survive in the harsh environment. Plants tend to be tough and wiry with small or no leaves, water-resistant cuticles, and often spines to deter herbivory. Some annual plants germinate, bloom, and die within a few weeks after rainfall, while other long-lived plants survive for years and have deep root systems that are able to tap underground moisture. Animals need to keep cool and find enough food and water to survive. Many are nocturnal and stay in the shade or underground during the day's heat. They tend to be efficient at conserving water, extracting most of their needs from their food and concentrating their urine. Some animals remain in a state of dormancy for long periods, ready to become active again during the rare rainfall. They then reproduce rapidly while conditions are favorable before returning to dormancy.
People have struggled to live in deserts and the surrounding semi-arid lands for millennia. Nomads have moved their flocks and herds to wherever grazing is available, and oases have provided opportunities for a more settled way of life. The cultivation of semi-arid regions encourages erosion of soil and is one of the causes of increased desertification. Desert farming is possible with the aid of irrigation, and the Imperial Valley in California provides an example of how previously barren land can be made productive by the import of water from an outside source. Many trade routes have been forged across deserts, especially across the Sahara, and traditionally were used by caravans of camels carrying salt, gold, ivory and other goods. Large numbers of slaves were also taken northwards across the Sahara. Some mineral extraction also takes place in deserts, and the uninterrupted sunlight gives potential for capturing large quantities of solar energy.

Etymology
English desert and its Romance cognates (including Italian and Portuguese deserto, French désert and Spanish desierto) all come from the ecclesiastical Latin dēsertum (originally ""an abandoned place""), a participle of dēserere, ""to abandon"". The correlation between aridity and sparse population is complex and dynamic, varying by culture, era, and technologies; thus the use of the word desert can cause confusion. In English before the 20th century, desert was often used in the sense of ""unpopulated area"", without specific reference to aridity; but today the word is most often used in its climate-science sense (an area of low precipitation). Phrases such as ""desert island"" and ""Great American Desert"", or Shakespeare's ""deserts of Bohemia"" (The Winter's Tale) in previous centuries did not necessarily imply sand or aridity; their focus was the sparse population.

Major deserts
Deserts occupy about one third of Earth's land surface. Bottomlands may be salt-covered flats. Eolian processes are major factors in shaping desert landscapes. Polar deserts (also seen as ""cold deserts"") have similar features, except the main form of precipitation is snow rather than rain.

Mathematics,"Mathematics is a field of study that discovers and organizes methods, theories and theorems that are developed and proved for the needs of empirical sciences and mathematics itself. There are many areas of mathematics, which include number theory (the study of numbers), algebra (the study of formulas and related structures), geometry (the study of shapes and spaces that contain them), analysis (the study of continuous changes), and set theory (presently used as a foundation for all mathematics).
Mathematics involves the description and manipulation of abstract objects that consist of either abstractions from nature or—in modern mathematics—purely abstract entities that are stipulated to have certain properties, called axioms.  Mathematics uses pure reason to prove properties of objects, a proof consisting of a succession of applications of deductive rules to already established results. These results include previously proved theorems, axioms, and—in case of abstraction from nature—some basic properties that are considered true starting points of the theory under consideration.
Mathematics is essential in the natural sciences, engineering, medicine, finance, computer science, and the social sciences. Although mathematics is extensively used for modeling phenomena, the fundamental truths of mathematics are independent of any scientific experimentation. Some areas of mathematics, such as statistics and game theory, are developed in close correlation with their applications and are often grouped under applied mathematics. Other areas are developed independently from any application (and are therefore called pure mathematics) but often later find practical applications.
Historically, the concept of a proof and its associated mathematical rigour first appeared in Greek mathematics, most notably in Euclid's Elements. Since its beginning, mathematics was primarily divided into geometry and arithmetic (the manipulation of natural numbers and fractions), until the 16th and 17th centuries, when algebra and infinitesimal calculus were introduced as new fields. Since then, the interaction between mathematical innovations and scientific discoveries has led to a correlated increase in the development of both. At the end of the 19th century, the foundational crisis of mathematics led to the systematization of the axiomatic method, which heralded a dramatic increase in the number of mathematical areas and their fields of application. The contemporary Mathematics Subject Classification lists more than sixty first-level areas of mathematics.

Areas of mathematics
Before the Renaissance, mathematics was divided into two main areas: arithmetic, regarding the manipulation of numbers, and geometry, regarding the study of shapes. Some types of pseudoscience, such as numerology and astrology, were not then clearly distinguished from mathematics.
During the Renaissance, two more areas appeared. Mathematical notation led to algebra which, roughly speaking, consists of the study and the manipulation of formulas. Calculus, consisting of the two subfields differential calculus and integral calculus, is the study of continuous functions, which model the typically nonlinear relationships between varying quantities, as represented by variables. This division into four main areas—arithmetic, geometry, algebra, and calculus—endured until the end of the 19th century. Areas such as celestial mechanics and solid mechanics were then studied by mathematicians, but now are considered as belonging to physics. The subject of combinatorics has been studied for much of recorded history, yet did not become a separate branch of mathematics until the seventeenth century.
At the end of the 19th century, the foundational crisis in mathematics and the resulting systematization of the axiomatic method led to an explosion of new areas of mathematics. The 2020 Mathematics Subject Classification contains no less than sixty-three first-level areas. Some of these areas correspond to the older division, as is true regarding number theory (the modern name for higher arithmetic) and geometry. Several other first-level areas have ""geometry"" in their names or are otherwise commonly considered part of geometry. Algebra and calculus do not appear as first-level areas but are respectively split into several first-level areas. Other first-level areas emerged during the 20th century or had not previously been considered as mathematics, such as mathematical logic and foundations.

Rank–size distribution,"Rank–size distribution is the distribution of size by rank, in decreasing order of size. For example, if a data set consists of items of sizes 5, 100, 5, and 8, the rank-size distribution is 100, 8, 5, 5 (ranks 1 through 4). This is also known as the rank–frequency distribution, when the source data are from a frequency distribution. These are particularly of interest when the data vary significantly in scales, such as city size or word frequency. These distributions frequently follow a power law distribution, or less well-known ones such as a stretched exponential function or parabolic fractal distribution, at least approximately for certain ranges of ranks; see below.
A rank-size distribution is not a probability distribution or cumulative distribution function. Rather, it is a discrete form of a quantile function (inverse cumulative distribution) in reverse order, giving the size of the element at a given rank.

Simple rank–size distributions
In the case of city populations, the resulting distribution in a country, a region, or the world will be characterized by its largest city, with other cities decreasing in size respective to it, initially at a rapid rate and then more slowly. This results in a few large cities and a much larger number of cities orders of magnitude smaller. For example, a rank 3 city would have one-third the population of a country's largest city, a rank 4 city would have one-fourth the population of the largest city, and so on.

Segmentation
A rank-size (or rank–frequency) distribution is often segmented into ranges. This is frequently done somewhat arbitrarily or due to external factors, particularly for market segmentation, but can also be due to distinct behavior as rank varies.
Most simply and commonly, a distribution may be split in two pieces, termed the head and tail. If a distribution is broken into three pieces, the third (middle) piece has several terms, generically middle, also belly, torso, and body. These frequently have some adjectives added, most significantly long tail, also fat belly, chunky middle, etc. In more traditional terms, these may be called top-tier, mid-tier, and bottom-tier.
The relative sizes and weights of these segments (how many ranks in each segment, and what proportion of the total population is in a given segment) qualitatively characterize a distribution, analogously to the skewness or kurtosis of a probability distribution. Namely: is it dominated by a few top members (head-heavy, like profits in the recorded music industry), or is it dominated by many small members (tail-heavy, like internet search queries), or distributed in some other way? Practically, this determines strategy: where should attention be focused?
These distinctions may be made for various reasons. For example, they may arise from differing properties of the population, as in the 90–9–1 principle, which posits that in an internet community, 90% of the participants of a community only view content, 9% of the participants edit content, and 1% of the participants actively create new content. As another example, in marketing, one may pragmatically consider the head as all members that receive personalized attention, such as personal phone calls; while the tail is everything else, which does not receive personalized attention, for example receiving form letters; and the line is simply set at a point that resources allow, or where it makes business sense to stop.
Purely quantitatively, a conventional way of splitting a distribution into head and tail is to consider the head to be the first p portion of ranks, which account for 
  
    
      
        1
        −
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle 1-p}
  
 of the overall population, as in the 80:20 Pareto principle, where the top 20% (head) comprises 80% of the overall population. The exact cutoff depends on the distribution – each distribution has a single such cutoff point—and for power, laws can be computed from the Pareto index.
Segments may arise naturally due to actual changes in the behavior of the distribution as rank varies. Most common is the king effect, where the behavior of the top handful of items does not fit the pattern of the rest, as illustrated at the top for country populations, and above for most common words in English Wikipedia. For higher ranks, behavior may change at some point, and be well-modeled by different relations in different regions; on the whole by a piecewise function. For example, if two different power laws fit better in different regions, one can use a broken power law for the overall relation; the word frequency in English Wikipedia (above) also demonstrates this.
The Yule–Simon distribution that results from preferential attachment (intuitively, ""the rich get richer"" and ""success breeds success"") simulates a broken power law and has been shown to ""very well capture"" word frequency versus rank distributions.  It originated from trying to explain the population versus rank in different spec",Geography,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rank%E2%80%93size_distribution,1,rank–size distribution distribution size rank decreasing order size example data set consists item size ranksize distribution rank also known rank–frequency distribution source data frequency distribution particularly interest data vary significantly scale city size word frequency distribution frequently follow power law distribution less wellknown one stretched exponential function parabolic fractal distribution least approximately certain range rank see ranksize distribution probability distribution cumulative distribution function rather discrete form quantile function inverse cumulative distribution reverse order giving size element given rank simple rank–size distribution case city population resulting distribution country region world characterized largest city city decreasing size respective initially rapid rate slowly result large city much larger number city order magnitude smaller example rank city would onethird population country largest city rank city would onefourth population largest city segmentation ranksize rank–frequency distribution often segmented range frequently done somewhat arbitrarily due external factor particularly market segmentation also due distinct behavior rank varies simply commonly distribution may split two piece termed head tail distribution broken three piece third middle piece several term generically middle also belly torso body frequently adjective added significantly long tail also fat belly chunky middle etc traditional term may called toptier midtier bottomtier relative size weight segment many rank segment proportion total population given segment qualitatively characterize distribution analogously skewness kurtosis probability distribution namely dominated top member headheavy like profit recorded music industry dominated many small member tailheavy like internet search query distributed way practically determines strategy attention focused distinction may made various reason example may arise differing property population –– principle posit internet community participant community view content participant edit content participant actively create new content another example marketing one may pragmatically consider head member receive personalized attention personal phone call tail everything else receive personalized attention example receiving form letter line simply set point resource allow make business sense stop purely quantitatively conventional way splitting distribution head tail consider head first p portion rank account − p displaystyle p overall population pareto principle top head comprises overall population exact cutoff depends distribution – distribution single cutoff point—and power law computed pareto index segment may arise naturally due actual change behavior distribution rank varies common king effect behavior top handful item fit pattern rest illustrated top country population common word english wikipedia higher rank behavior may change point wellmodeled different relation different region whole piecewise function example two different power law fit better different region one use broken power law overall relation word frequency english wikipedia also demonstrates yule–simon distribution result preferential attachment intuitively rich get richer success breed success simulates broken power law shown well capture word frequency versus rank distribution originated trying explain population versus rank different spec
River,"A river is a natural stream of fresh water that flows on land or inside caves towards another body of water at a lower elevation, such as an ocean, lake, or another river. A river may run dry before reaching the end of its course if it runs out of water, or only flow during certain seasons. Rivers are regulated by the water cycle, the processes by which water moves around the Earth. Water first enters rivers through precipitation, whether from rainfall, the runoff of water down a slope, the melting of glaciers or snow, or seepage from aquifers beneath the surface of the Earth.
Rivers flow in channeled watercourses and merge in confluences to form drainage basins, or catchments, areas where surface water eventually flows to a common outlet. Rivers have a great effect on the landscape around them. They may regularly overflow their banks and flood the surrounding area, spreading nutrients to the surrounding area. Sediment or alluvium carried by rivers shapes the landscape around it, forming deltas and islands where the flow slows down. Rivers rarely run in a straight line, instead, they bend or meander; the locations of a river's banks can change frequently. Rivers get their alluvium from erosion, which carves rock into canyons and valleys.
Rivers have sustained human and animal life for millennia, including the first human civilizations. The organisms that live around or in a river such as fish, aquatic plants, fungi, molluscs, and insects have different roles, including primary production, processing organic matter, predation, parasitism, and decomposition. Rivers have produced abundant resources for humans, including food, transportation, drinking water, and recreation. Humans have throughout history engineered rivers to prevent flooding, irrigate crops, perform work with water wheels, and produce hydroelectricity from dams. People associate rivers with life and fertility and have strong religious, political, social, and mythological attachments to them.
Rivers and river ecosystems are threatened by water pollution, climate change, and human activity. The construction of dams, canals, levees, and other engineered structures has eliminated habitats, has caused the extinction of some species, increased nutrient avilability to toxic levels, and lowered the amount of alluvium flowing through rivers. Decreased snowfall from climate change has resulted in less water available for rivers during the summer. Regulation of pollution, dam removal, and sewage treatment have helped to improve water quality and restore river habitats. Certain organisms such as sponges and fungi are useful bioindicators for river health.

Topography
Definition
A river is a natural flow of freshwater that flows on or through land towards another body of water downhill. This flow can be into a lake, an ocean, or another river. A stream refers to water that flows in a natural channel, a geographic feature that can contain flowing water. A stream may also be referred to as a watercourse. The study of the movement of water as it occurs on Earth is called hydrology, and their effect on the landscape is covered by geomorphology.

Source and drainage basin
Rivers are part of the water cycle, the continuous processes by which water moves about Earth. This means that all water that flows in rivers must ultimately come from precipitation. The sides of rivers have land that is at a higher elevation than the river itself, and in these areas, water flows downhill into the river. The headwaters of a river are the smaller streams that feed a river, and make up the river's source. These streams may be small and flow rapidly down the sides of mountains. All of the land uphill of a river that feeds it with water in this way is in that river's drainage basin or watershed. A ridge of higher elevation land is what typically separates drainage basins; water on one side of a ridge will flow into one set of rivers, and water on the other side will flow into another. One example of this is the Continental Divide of the Americas in the Rocky Mountains. Water on the western side of the divide flows into the Pacific Ocean, whereas water on the other side flows into the Atlantic Ocean.

Not all precipitation flows directly into rivers; some water seeps into underground aquifers. These, in turn, can still feed rivers via the water table, the groundwater beneath the surface of the land stored in the soil. Water flows into rivers in places where the river's elevation is lower than that of the water table. This phenomenon is why rivers can still flow even during times of drought. Rivers are also fed by the melting of snow glaciers present in higher elevation regions. In summer months, higher temperatures melt snow and ice, causing additional water to flow into rivers. Glacier melt can supplement snow melt in times like the late summer, when there may be less snow left to melt, helping to ensure that the rivers downstream of the glaciers have a continuous supply of water.

Blue space,"In urban planning and design, blue space (or blue infrastructure) comprises areas dominated by surface waterbodies or watercourses. In conjunction with greenspace (parks, gardens, etc. specifically: urban open space), it may help in reducing the risks of heat-related illness from high urban temperatures (urban heat island).
Substantial urban waterbodies naturally exist as integral features of the geography of many cities because of their historical development, for example the River Thames in London.
Accessible blue spaces can help revitalizing neighborhoods and promote increased social connectedness as seen on waterfront renovation projects like the Chattanooga Waterfront (Chattanooga, Tennessee),  the CityDeck in Green Bay, Wisconsin, or the Brooklyn Bridge Park in New York City, further enhanced by waterfront festivals such as the Christmas lights in Medellin, in Colombia. Design guidelines promoting healthy buildings -such as, WELL -managed by The International WELL Building Institute™ (IWBI™), or Fitwel -developed and managed by The Center for Active Design (CfAD), recommend incorporating  including and water features as a strategy to improve the health and wellness of the building occupants, and ""the 9 foundations of a Healthy Building"" -developed at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health-, also recommends indoor access to nature views or nature-inspired elements.
Because neighborhoods with access to attractive natural features are susceptible to gentrification, the social benefits associated with waterbodies can be unequally distributed, with less affluent areas lacking access to good quality blue spaces.

Health benefits
Proximity to water bodies may bring some risks to humans, like water-borne diseases in drinking water, flooding risks, or drowning. But scientific evidence shows that exposure to blue spaces is also associated with a variety of health benefits to those near water bodies.
This is described by marine biologist Wallace J. Nichols in his book Blue Mind. Another of the mechanisms by which this phenomenon can be explained is by the Biophilia hypothesis developed by Edward O. Wilson. This theory states that humans have developed a strong connection with nature throughout their evolution that leads to subconscious seeking for natural environments, including green and blue spaces.
Recent research has identified three main pathways that can further explain why proximity to green and blue spaces can be beneficial to health.

Mitigation addresses these health benefits in relationship to the physical improvements that natural environments bring to the built environment, such as reduction of urban heat island, traffic air pollution or traffic noise.
Instoration focuses on the promotion of physical activity and other positive outcomes associated with increased physical activity and social connectivity promoted by natural spaces.
Restoration explains how the non-threatening characteristics of the natural environments may reduce negative feelings and increase cognitive restoration.
Assessing the environmental benefits of a blue space intervention can be done by conducting a Health impact assessment (HIA).

Effects on physical health
Increased physical activity
A variety of studies have found that people living near coastal areas, are less sedentary  more likely to engage in moderate and vigorous physical activity adequate for health,  which could be explained due to the encouraging presence of walk paths along the coast. Another possible explanation is found in the aesthetical attributes of blue spaces that may motivate individuals to engage in physical activities on blue spaces. A study in England found that although more intense activities were conducted on visits to countryside and urban green spaces compared to visits to coastal environments, coastal visits were associated with the highest overall energy expenditure due duration of activity in coastal environments being longer. Results differed by the urbanity or rurality of the respondent's residence and also how far respondents travelled to their destination.
Proximity to water bodies alone is not enough to promote increased levels of physical activity, as those bodies need to be accessible to people. A study focusing on teenagers found that those living near beaches that had a major road between their homes and the water body had lower levels of physical activity than those with a direct access to the beach.

Reduced obesity
Visiting blue spaces may reduce obesity as it promotes increased physical activity. One study has suggested that living far from usable green space or waterfront in urban areas may increase the risk of obesity.

Improved respiratory health
Living near blue spaces can improve the quality of life of people with respiratory diseases, such as asthma, which could be explained by the mists and sprays generated by the water movement as shown on a study measuring the impact in health of green and blue spaces for those with chr",Rivers,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_space,1,urban planning design blue space blue infrastructure comprises area dominated surface waterbodies watercourse conjunction greenspace park garden etc specifically urban open space may help reducing risk heatrelated illness high urban temperature urban heat island substantial urban waterbodies naturally exist integral feature geography many city historical development example river thames london accessible blue space help revitalizing neighborhood promote increased social connectedness seen waterfront renovation project like chattanooga waterfront chattanooga tennessee citydeck green bay wisconsin brooklyn bridge park new york city enhanced waterfront festival christmas light medellin colombia design guideline promoting healthy building well managed international well building institute™ iwbi™ fitwel developed managed center active design cfad recommend incorporating including water feature strategy improve health wellness building occupant foundation healthy building developed harvard th chan school public health also recommends indoor access nature view natureinspired element neighborhood access attractive natural feature susceptible gentrification social benefit associated waterbodies unequally distributed less affluent area lacking access good quality blue space health benefit proximity water body may bring risk human like waterborne disease drinking water flooding risk drowning scientific evidence show exposure blue space also associated variety health benefit near water body described marine biologist wallace j nichols book blue mind another mechanism phenomenon explained biophilia hypothesis developed edward wilson theory state human developed strong connection nature throughout evolution lead subconscious seeking natural environment including green blue space recent research identified three main pathway explain proximity green blue space beneficial health mitigation address health benefit relationship physical improvement natural environment bring built environment reduction urban heat island traffic air pollution traffic noise instoration focus promotion physical activity positive outcome associated increased physical activity social connectivity promoted natural space restoration explains nonthreatening characteristic natural environment may reduce negative feeling increase cognitive restoration assessing environmental benefit blue space intervention done conducting health impact assessment hia effect physical health increased physical activity variety study found people living near coastal area less sedentary likely engage moderate vigorous physical activity adequate health could explained due encouraging presence walk path along coast another possible explanation found aesthetical attribute blue space may motivate individual engage physical activity blue space study england found although intense activity conducted visit countryside urban green space compared visit coastal environment coastal visit associated highest overall energy expenditure due duration activity coastal environment longer result differed urbanity rurality respondent residence also far respondent travelled destination proximity water body alone enough promote increased level physical activity body need accessible people study focusing teenager found living near beach major road home water body lower level physical activity direct access beach reduced obesity visiting blue space may reduce obesity promotes increased physical activity one study suggested living far usable green space waterfront urban area may increase risk obesity improved respiratory health living near blue space improve quality life people respiratory disease asthma could explained mist spray generated water movement shown study measuring impact health green blue space chr
Outline of geography,"The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to geography:
Geography – study of Earth and its people.

Nature of geography
Geography as
an academic discipline – a body of knowledge given to − or received by − a disciple (student); a branch or sphere of knowledge, or field of study, that an individual has chosen to specialize in. Modern geography is an all-encompassing discipline that seeks to understand the Earth and its human and natural complexities − not merely where objects are, but how they have changed and come to be. Geography has been called 'the world discipline'.
a field of science – widely recognized category of specialized expertise within science, and typically embodies its own terminology and nomenclature. This field will usually be represented by one or more scientific journals, where peer-reviewed research is published. There are many geography-related scientific journals.
a natural science – field of academic scholarship that explores aspects of the natural environment (physical geography).
a social science – field of academic scholarship that explores aspects of human society (human geography).
an interdisciplinary field – a field that crosses traditional boundaries between academic disciplines or schools of thought, as new needs and professions have emerged. Many of the branches of physical geography are also branches of Earth science

Branches of geography
As ""the bridge between the human and physical sciences,"" geography is divided into two main branches:

human geography
physical geography
Other branches include:

integrated geography
technical geography
regional geography

Physical geography
Physical geography – examines the natural environment and how the climate, vegetation and life, soil, water, and landforms are produced and interact.

Fields of physical geography
Geomorphology – study of landforms and the processes that them, and more broadly, of the processes controlling the topography of any planet. It seeks to understand why landscapes look the way they do, to understand landform history and dynamics, and to predict future changes through field observation, physical experiments, and numerical modeling.
Hydrology – study water movement, distribution, and quality throughout the Earth, including the hydrologic cycle, water resources, and environmental watershed sustainability.
Glaciology – study of glaciers, or more generally ice and natural phenomena that involve ice.
Oceanography – studies a wide range of topics about oceans, including marine organisms and ecosystem dynamics; ocean currents, waves, and geophysical fluid dynamics; plate tectonics and the geology of the sea floor; and fluxes of various chemical substances and physical properties within the ocean and across its boundaries.
Biogeography – study of species distribution spatially and temporally. Over areal ecological changes, it is also tied to the concepts of species and their past, or present living 'refugium', their survival locales, or their interim living sites. It aims to reveal where organisms live and at what abundance.
Climatology – study of climate, scientifically defined as weather conditions averaged over a period of time.
Meteorology is the interdisciplinary scientific study of the atmosphere that focuses on weather processes and short-term forecasting (in contrast with climatology).
Pedology – study of soils in their natural environment that deals with pedogenesis, soil morphology, and soil classification.
Palaeogeography – study of what geography was in times past, most often concerning the physical landscape and the human or cultural environment.
Coastal geography – study of the dynamic interface between the ocean and the land, incorporating both the physical geography (i.e., coastal geomorphology, geology, and oceanography) and the human geography (sociology and history) of the coast. It involves understanding coastal weathering processes, particularly wave action, sediment movement, and weather, as well as how humans interact with the coast.
Quaternary science – focuses on the Quaternary period, which encompasses the last 2.6 million years, including the last ice age and the Holocene period.
Landscape ecology – the relationship between spatial patterns of urban development and ecological processes on many landscape scales and organizational levels.

Approaches of physical geography
Quantitative geography – Quantitative research tools and methods applied to geography. See also the quantitative revolution.
Systems approach –

Human geography
Human geography – one of the two main subfields of geography is the study of human use and understanding of the world and the processes that have affected it. Human geography broadly differs from physical geography in that it focuses on the built environment and how space is created, viewed, and managed by humans, as well as the influence humans have on the space they occupy.

Fields of human geography

Domestic realism,"Domestic realism normally refers to the genre of 19th-century fictional works about the daily lives of ordinary Victorian women. This body of writing is also known as ""sentimental fiction"" or ""woman's fiction"". The genre is mainly reflected in the novel though short-stories and non-fiction works such as Harriet Beecher Stowe's ""Our Country Neighbors"" and The New Housekeeper's Manual written by Stowe and her sister Catharine Beecher are works of domestic realism.

Generic conventions
The style's particular characteristics are:

""Plot focuses on a heroine who embodies one of two types of exemplar: the angel and the practical woman (Reynolds) who sometimes exist in the same work. Baym says that this heroine is contrasted with the passive woman (incompetent, cowardly, ignorant; often the heroine's mother is this type) and the ""belle,"" who is deprived of a proper education.
The heroine struggles for self-mastery, learning the pain of conquering her own passions (Tompkins, Sensational Designs, 172).
The heroine learns to balance society's demands for self-denial with her own desire for autonomy, a struggle often addressed in terms of religion.
She suffers at the hands of abusers of power before establishing a network of surrogate kin.
The plots ""repeatedly identify immersion in feeling as one of the great temptations and dangers for a developing woman. They show that feeling must be controlled. . . "" (Baym 25). Frances Cogan notes that the heroines thus undergo a full education within which to realize feminine obligations (The All-American Girl).
The tales generally end with marriage, usually one of two possible kinds:
Reforming the bad or ""wild"" male, as in Augusta Evans's St. Elmo (1867)
Marrying the solid male who already meets her qualifications. Examples: Maria Cummins, The Lamplighter (1854) and Susan Warner, The Wide, Wide World (1850)
The novels may use a ""language of tears"" that evokes sympathy from the readers.
Richard Brodhead (Cultures of Letters) sees class as an important issue, as the ideal family or heroine is poised between a lower-class family exemplifying poverty and domestic disorganization and upper-class characters exemplifying an idle, frivolous existence (94).""

Examples
An example of this style of novel is Jane Smiley's A Thousand Acres, in which the main character's confinement is emphasized in such a way.
Some early exponents of the genre of domestic realism were Jane Austen and Elizabeth Barrett Browning.

Geocivilization,"Geocivilization is an interdisciplinary concept that studies how physical environments (deserts, rivers, mountains, trade routes) and human societies shape each other over centuries. Unlike environmental determinism—which claims that terrain or climate alone dictate cultural outcomes—geocivilization emphasizes a two-way dialogue between human decisions and natural settings.

Historical and theoretical background
From environmental determinism to geo-cultural systems
Early theories of civilization held that physical geography directly determined social structures and political power. Modern geocivilization rejects simple cause and effect, focusing instead on the ongoing interaction between people’s choices and geographic conditions over long periods.
In 2012, Ruan Wei defined geocivilization as a ""macro-geo-continuum where multiple civilizations share a geographical locus, cultural values, and reduced costs of association,"" highlighting how shared space and culture facilitate cooperation. This view contrasts with older approaches that analyze civilizations as separate cultural or political entities.
Delanty and Isin introduce a spatiotemporal framework—literally a “space + time” lens—that shows how ideas and environments co-evolve, rather than following a linear path.

Ahmed Sarirete’s geocivilizational framework
Ahmed Sarirete defines geocivilization as the “dynamic interplay between geo-cultural environments and civilizational trajectories.” In his view, while deserts often inspire spirituality and a reliance on divine support, river basins, trade corridors, and other natural landscapes foster independence and serve as “incubation spaces” for human innovation, nurturing the emergence of institutions, beliefs, ethics, and technologies independently of divine intervention.
In contrast to geopolitics, which primarily focuses on short-term power dynamics, Sarirete emphasizes the long-term impact of deeply rooted values—such as justice, faith (whether in the divine or in humanity), community, and innovation—on the global trajectories of civilizations.

Methodological innovation
Geo-historical reference systems
Modern scholars are increasingly constructing geo-historical maps to trace the movement of ideas, goods, and populations over centuries, revealing how physical landscapes have shaped cultural and political trajectories. These efforts blend insights from archaeology, climatology, and cultural history, providing a richer understanding of the deep connections between geography and civilization.

Yellow River Basin (China): Early Chinese dynasties invested heavily in canal networks and flood control systems, transforming the Yellow River basin into a cradle of centralized state power. These hydraulic projects not only facilitated agricultural expansion but also reinforced Confucian ideals of order, stability, and hierarchical governance, shaping the political and philosophical foundations of Chinese civilization.
Himalaya–Karakoram Region: Recent studies of glacial retreat and changing monsoon patterns reveal the significant impact of climate shifts on historical trade and pilgrimage routes. These environmental changes forced mountain communities to adapt, altering cultural exchanges and influencing the spread of Buddhism along the ancient Silk Routes.
Together, these examples illustrate how geo-historical mapping can uncover the complex interactions between human societies and their natural environments, highlighting the deep roots of contemporary cultural and economic patterns.

Comparative civilizational analysis
Ruan Wei's geo-economic framework emphasizes the powerful role of shared geography and cultural affinities in shaping economic relations. According to this perspective, neighboring regions that share historical and cultural bonds tend to experience lower trade costs and stronger economic cooperation. This is particularly evident in East Asia, where China and ASEAN countries maintain robust trade relationships despite periodic political tensions. These ties are reinforced by centuries of economic interdependence, shared cultural heritage, and complementary economic structures, which together create a resilient foundation for regional cooperation, even in the face of shifting political landscapes.

Critiques and debates
Essentialization risks
One of the main critiques of the geocivilizational approach is the risk of essentializing entire regions into monolithic cultural blocs, such as referring to ""Islamic civilization"" or ""East Asia"" as if they were internally homogeneous and static. This perspective can obscure the rich diversity of languages, cultures, and historical experiences within these regions. Postcolonial scholars, drawing on the work of thinkers like Dipesh Chakrabarty, emphasize the importance of ""provincializing"" dominant narratives to avoid reducing complex societies to oversimplified categories. Chakrabarty argues for an approach that centers indigenous spatial knowledge, acknowledgi",Geography,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocivilization,1,geocivilization interdisciplinary concept study physical environment desert river mountain trade route human society shape century unlike environmental determinism—which claim terrain climate alone dictate cultural outcomes—geocivilization emphasizes twoway dialogue human decision natural setting historical theoretical background environmental determinism geocultural system early theory civilization held physical geography directly determined social structure political power modern geocivilization reject simple cause effect focusing instead ongoing interaction people ’ choice geographic condition long period ruan wei defined geocivilization macrogeocontinuum multiple civilization share geographical locus cultural value reduced cost association highlighting shared space culture facilitate cooperation view contrast older approach analyze civilization separate cultural political entity delanty isin introduce spatiotemporal framework—literally “ space time ” lens—that show idea environment coevolve rather following linear path ahmed sarirete ’ geocivilizational framework ahmed sarirete defines geocivilization “ dynamic interplay geocultural environment civilizational trajectory ” view desert often inspire spirituality reliance divine support river basin trade corridor natural landscape foster independence serve “ incubation space ” human innovation nurturing emergence institution belief ethic technology independently divine intervention contrast geopolitics primarily focus shortterm power dynamic sarirete emphasizes longterm impact deeply rooted values—such justice faith whether divine humanity community innovation—on global trajectory civilization methodological innovation geohistorical reference system modern scholar increasingly constructing geohistorical map trace movement idea good population century revealing physical landscape shaped cultural political trajectory effort blend insight archaeology climatology cultural history providing richer understanding deep connection geography civilization yellow river basin china early chinese dynasty invested heavily canal network flood control system transforming yellow river basin cradle centralized state power hydraulic project facilitated agricultural expansion also reinforced confucian ideal order stability hierarchical governance shaping political philosophical foundation chinese civilization himalaya–karakoram region recent study glacial retreat changing monsoon pattern reveal significant impact climate shift historical trade pilgrimage route environmental change forced mountain community adapt altering cultural exchange influencing spread buddhism along ancient silk route together example illustrate geohistorical mapping uncover complex interaction human society natural environment highlighting deep root contemporary cultural economic pattern comparative civilizational analysis ruan wei geoeconomic framework emphasizes powerful role shared geography cultural affinity shaping economic relation according perspective neighboring region share historical cultural bond tend experience lower trade cost stronger economic cooperation particularly evident east asia china asean country maintain robust trade relationship despite periodic political tension tie reinforced century economic interdependence shared cultural heritage complementary economic structure together create resilient foundation regional cooperation even face shifting political landscape critique debate essentialization risk one main critique geocivilizational approach risk essentializing entire region monolithic cultural bloc referring islamic civilization east asia internally homogeneous static perspective obscure rich diversity language culture historical experience within region postcolonial scholar drawing work thinker like dipesh chakrabarty emphasize importance provincializing dominant narrative avoid reducing complex society oversimplified category chakrabarty argues approach center indigenous spatial knowledge acknowledgi

TidyTuesday,"TidyTuesday, also noted as Tidy Tuesday, tidytuesday, or #tidytuesday, is a weekly community of practice that is currently organized by the Data Science Learning Community (DSLC). A new data set is highlighted each week for participants to practice exploring, visualizing, and sharing findings. Participants can follow the daily hashtag #tidytuesday on social media.

History
TidyTuesday was started by Tom Mock, a product manager at Posit PBC, on April 1, 2018. The motivations to create this was for newcomers to data and more experienced data scientists to feel less socially isolated and a means to practice skills like acquiring, cleaning, wrangling, visualizing and presenting data. Some participants have shared feeling inspired by others' data visualizations and noting that most people will share their code in order to replicate their work.

Impact
TidyTuesday has also been used by other groups or features published data. R-Ladies Global have used TidyTuesday datasets as a hackathon to practice data skills. In February 2021, Allen Hillery, Athony Starks, and Sekou Tyler, started the #DuboisChallenge. This challenge had participants use modern data visualization tools to recreate the data visualizations by sociologist and activist W.E.B.Du Bois. Then in 2021 and 2022, TidyTuesday highlighted these datasets for the data community. In 2021, TidyTuesday featured the zipcodeR dataset that contains 41,000 ZIP codes for analysis.

Educators training data scientists have struggled to coordinate their preparation, but some have suggested to create a portfolio to have highlight technical skills and data thinking skills. TidyTuesday is one suggested way to find datasets to create a formal, visual project. This can be a means to help teach novice data practitioners on how to better program in programming languages like the R programming language.

Grauman's Egyptian Theatre,"Grauman's Egyptian Theatre, also known as Egyptian Hollywood and the Egyptian, is a historic movie theater located on Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California. Opened in 1922, it is an early example of a lavish movie palace and is noted as having been the site of the world's first film premiere, however, its popularity was supplanted by Grauman's Chinese Theatre when it opened five years later.
From 1998 until 2020, the Egyptian was owned and operated by the American Cinematheque, and in May 2020, Netflix bought the theater. Following a large restoration project, the theater re-opened in November 2023, with Netflix handling the programming Monday through Thursday and the American Cinematheque overseeing Friday through Sunday.

History
Origins
The Egyptian was built by showman Sid Grauman and real estate developer Charles E. Toberman, who subsequently built the nearby El Capitan Theatre and Chinese Theatre. Grauman had previously opened one of the United States's first movie palaces, the Million Dollar Theater, part of the Broadway Theater District in Downtown Los Angeles. The Egyptian cost $800,000 ($15 million in 2024) and took 18 months to construct. Architects Meyer & Holler designed the building, and it was built by Meyer & Holler affiliate, the Milwaukee Building Company.
The Egyptian was the location of world's first film premiere, Douglas Fairbanks in Robin Hood, on Wednesday, October 18, 1922. As the film reportedly cost over $1 million ($18.8 million in 2024) to produce, the admission price to the premiere was $5 ($94.00 in 2024). One could reserve a seat up to two weeks in advance for the daily performances. Evening admission was 75¢, $1, or $1.50. The film was not shown in any other Los Angeles theater that year. Premieres that took place at the Egyptian after Douglas Fairbanks in Robin Hood include The Ten Commandments in 1923, The Thief of Bagdad in 1924, and The Gold Rush in 1925.

Decline
In 1927, Grauman opened a second movie theater further west on Hollywood Boulevard. In keeping with the public's fascination with international themes, he named his new theater the Chinese Theatre. Its popularity surpassed the Egyptian, most likely due to the Chinese's celebrity handprints, footprints, and signatures in the concrete of its forecourt.
Following the opening of the Chinese, Fox West Coast Theaters operated the Egyptian as a re-run house. The theater returned to first-run premieres in 1944, when it became the exclusive Hollywood showcase for MGM, but due to 1949's United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., which barred major studios from operating movie theaters, MGM was forced to relinquish this and all its other theaters. United Artists operated this theater from 1949 to 1992, with the theater showcasing 20th Century Fox films from the 1970s onwards.
In 1955, a large curved Todd-AO screen was added to the theater, with much of the theater's original proscenium arch demolished to make room for the screen.
In 1984, the Hollywood Boulevard Commercial and Entertainment District was added to the National Register of Historic Places, with the Egyptian Theatre listed as a contributing property in the district. In 1992, the theater closed and fell into disrepair. In 1993, it was designated a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument.

American Cinematheque revitalization
In 1996, the Community Redevelopment Agency of Los Angeles sold the theater to the American Cinematheque for a nominal $1 with the provision that the building be restored to its original grandeur and reopened as a movie theater.
The Cinematheque raised $12.8 million ($28.7 million in 2024) to pay for the restoration, and the theater was reopened to the public on December 4, 1998. The original theater sat 1,760 patrons in a single auditorium, while the restored Egyptian added a second theater. The main theater accommodated 616 patrons and was named after Los Angeles philanthropist Lloyd E. Rigler, while the second theater accommodated 78 and was named after Steven Spielberg. In addition to these renovations, the Egyptian's forecourt was restored to its original 1922 appearance, and palm trees and planters were also added.

Netflix
In April 2019, it was announced that Netflix was seeking to purchase the theater to use as a special events venue, qualify its films for Oscar nominations, screen its films and television shows for Oscar and Emmy voters, and that the American Cinematheque would still hold events on weekends. Immediately after the announcement, a petition campaign called on the American Cinematheque board, the California Attorney General, and Los Angeles City Council to hold a public meeting about the proposed sale. On May 29, 2020, it was announced that Netflix would acquire the theater and invest in renovations. The theater's purchase price was reported to be $14.4 million ($17.5 million in 2024), and the renovations, which included a seismic retrofit, totalled more than $70 million ($85 million in 2024).

Sociology of literature,"The sociology of literature is a subfield of the sociology of culture. It studies the social production of literature and its social implications. A notable example is Pierre Bourdieu's 1992  Les Règles de L'Art: Genèse et Structure du Champ Littéraire, translated by Susan Emanuel as Rules of Art: Genesis and Structure of the Literary Field (1996).

Classical sociology
None of the 'founding fathers' of sociology produced a detailed study of literature, but they did develop ideas that were subsequently applied to literature by others. Karl Marx's theory of ideology has been directed at literature by Pierre Macherey, Terry Eagleton and Fredric Jameson. Max Weber's theory of modernity as cultural rationalisation, which he applied to music, was later applied to all the arts, literature included, by Frankfurt School writers such as Theodor Adorno and Jürgen Habermas. Emile Durkheim's view of sociology as the study of externally defined social facts was redirected towards literature by Robert Escarpit. Bourdieu's work is clearly indebted to Marx, Weber and Durkheim.

Lukács and the theory of the novel
An important first step in the sociology of literature was taken by Georg Lukács's The Theory of the Novel, first published in German in 1916, in the Zeitschrift fur Aesthetik und Allgemeine Kunstwissenschaft. In 1920 it was republished in book form and this version strongly influenced the Frankfurt School. A second edition, published in 1962, was similarly influential on French structuralism. The Theory of the Novel argued that, whilst the classical epic poem had given form to a totality of life pregiven in reality by the social integration of classical civilisation, the modern novel had become 'the epic of an age in which the extensive totality of life is no longer directly given'. The novel form is therefore organised around the problematic hero in pursuit of problematic values within a problematic world.
Lukács's second distinctive contribution to the sociology of literature was The Historical Novel, written in German but first published in Russian in 1937, which appeared in English translation in 1962. Here, Lukács argued that the early 19th century historical novel's central achievement was to represent realistically the differences between pre-capitalist past and capitalist present. This was not a matter of individual talent, but of collective historical experience, because the French Revolution and the revolutionary and Napoleonic wars had made history for the first time a mass experience. He went on to argue that the success of the 1848 revolutions led to the decline of the historical novel into 'decorative monumentalization' and the 'making private of history'. The key figures in the historical novel were thus those of the early 19th century, especially Sir Walter Scott.
Lukács was an important influence on Lucien Goldmann's Towards a Sociology of the Novel, Alan Swingewood's discussion of the sociology of the novel in Part 3 of Laurenson and Swingewood's The Sociology of Literature and Franco Moretti's Signs Taken for Wonders.

The Frankfurt School
Founded in 1923, the Institute for Social Research at the University of Frankfurt developed a distinctive kind of 'critical sociology' indebted to Marx, Weber and Freud. Leading Frankfurt School critics who worked on literature included Adorno, Walter Benjamin and Leo Löwenthal. Adorno's Notes to Literature, Benjamin's The Origin of German Tragic Drama and Löwentahl's Literature and the Image of Man were each influential studies in the sociology of literature. Löwenthal continued this work at the University of California, Berkeley, during the 1950s.
Adorno's Notes to Literature is a collection of essays, the most influential of which is probably 'On Lyric Poetry and Society'. It argued that poetic thought is a reaction against the commodification and reification of modern life, citing Goethe and Baudelaire as examples. Benjamin's The Origin of German Tragic Drama argued that the extreme 'sovereign violence' of the 16th and 17th century German 'Trauerspiel' (literally mourning play, less literally tragedy) playwrights expressed the historical realities of princely power far better than had classical tragedy.
Habermas succeeded Adorno to the Chair of Sociology and Philosophy at Frankfurt. Habermas's first major work, Strukturwandel der Öffentlichkeit was published in German in 1962, and in English translation as The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere in 1989. It attempted to explain the socio-historical emergence of middle-class public opinion in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Developing a new kind of institutional sociology of literature, it argued that the public sphere had been organised around literary salons in France, learned and literary societies in Germany, and coffee houses in England. These institutions sustained the early novel, newspaper and periodical press.

How Data Happened,"How Data Happened: A History from the Age of Reason to the Age of Algorithms is a 2023 non-fiction book written by Columbia University professors Chris Wiggins and Matthew L. Jones. The book explores the history of data and statistics from the end of the 18th century to the present day.

Content
The book starts at the end of the 18th century, when European states began tabulating physical resources, and ends at the present day, when algorithms manipulate our personal information as a commodity. It looks at the rise of data and statistics, and how early statistical methods were used to justify eugenics, quantify supposed racial differences, and develop military and industrial applications. The authors also discuss the impact of the internet and e-commerce on data collection, the rise of data science, and the consequences of government-run surveillance systems collecting vast amounts of personal data for customized, targeted advertising. They emphasize the importance of privacy and democracy and propose remedies to the problems caused by mass data collection, including stronger regulation of the tech industry and collective action by its employees. The book is a historical analysis that provides context for understanding the debates surrounding data and its control.
The book has 336 pages and was published in 2023 by W. W. Norton & Company.

Volvo Island,"Volvo Island is a small man-made island located in a flooded strip mine near Ottawa, Illinois, United States. The island is called that due to its sole occupant: a 2001 Volvo S80 sedan. Since its placement in January 2012, the vehicle has remained a distinctive landmark of the area.

History
The creation of Volvo Island was the idea of Scott Mann, a resident of Ottawa and proprietor of two local car repair shops. The area surrounding the island was originally a strip mine that had been abandoned and subsequently filled with approximately 40 feet of standing water, forming a lake. In early 2012, Mann decided to place the Volvo on a peninsula extending into this lake. Utilizing a tow truck, the car was positioned at the end of the landmass. Subsequently, an excavator was used to remove the connecting land, effectively isolating the vehicle on its own small island.
Initially, Mann considered organizing a contest, inviting the public to guess how the car had been positioned on the island. However, due to safety concerns—specifically, the risk of individuals attempting to reach the island through deep waters—he decided against it. Nevertheless, for the fun of it, he still placed the vehicle there, hoping it would attract visitors to his shop.

Public reception
Over the years, Volvo Island has garnered attention as a tourist attraction. The site has been visible on Google Maps and Street View since 2015, leading to increased interest and visits from those intrigued by its unique appearance. As of recent accounts, the location boasts a 4.9-star rating on Google, based on over 300 reviews. Visitors often describe it as ""majestic"" and a ""premier tourist attraction"".

Current status
Despite its exposure to the elements over more than a decade, the 2001 Volvo S80 remains on the island, appearing relatively intact. There are no current plans to remove the vehicle or alter the island.

Mountain rescue,"Mountain rescue refers to search and rescue activities that occur in a mountainous environment, although the term is sometimes also used to apply to search and rescue in other wilderness environments. This tends to include mountains with technical rope access issues, snow, avalanches, ice, crevasses, glaciers, alpine environments and high altitudes. The difficult and remote nature of the terrain in which mountain rescue often occurs has resulted in the development of a number of specific pieces of equipment and techniques. Helicopters are often used to quickly extract casualties, and search dogs may be deployed to find a casualty.
Mountain rescue services may be paid professionals or volunteer professionals. Paid rescue services are more likely to exist in places with a high demand such as the Alps, national parks with mountain terrain and many ski resorts. However, the labor-intensive and occasional nature of mountain rescue, along with the specific techniques and local knowledge required for some environments, means that mountain rescue is often undertaken by voluntary teams. These are frequently made up of local climbers and guides. Often paid rescue services may work in co-operation with voluntary services. For instance, a paid helicopter rescue team may work with a volunteer mountain rescue team on the ground. Mountain rescue is often free, although in some parts of the world rescue organizations may charge for their services. But there are also exceptions, e.g. Switzerland, where mountain rescue is highly expensive (some 2,000 to US$4,000) and will be charged to the patient. In more remote or less-developed
parts of the world organized mountain rescue services are often negligible or non-existent.

By country
Austria
Österreichischer Bergrettungsdienst (ÖBRD) performs mountain rescue operations in the Austrian Alps and in Waldviertel.
Alpiner Rettungsausschuß Wien (ARAW) was founded in 1896 after an avalanche on Rax killed three mountaineers. In 1938 the organization was merged with the Deutsche Bergwacht. In 1946 (after World War II) the Austrian Mountain Rescue Service was (re)founded as Österreichischer Bergrettungsdienst.

Bosnia and Herzegovina
Due to its mountainous terrain, following the Second World War, Bosnia and Herzegovina saw a need for the development and organization of a modern-day equivalent of the mountain rescue service. The first mountain rescue ""station"", which consisted of professionally trained and semi-professional volunteers was founded in 1952 in Sarajevo and is the oldest continuously-functioning organization of such type in the present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina. As the need arose even further, stations in additional cities were established as well. The  Bosnian Mountain Rescue Union, although existent, acts merely as a supervisory-organization, as each station acts and finances itself independently, mostly relying on their distinguished municipal offices of Civil Defense.

Canada
In the five mountain national parks of the Canadian Rockies, mountain rescue is solely the responsibility of Parks Canada's visitor safety rescue specialists.
Large areas in all Canadian national parks do not have reliable two-way radio or cellular coverage. The use of SOS, satellite phone or two-way communicating send devices like Garmin InReach or Spot is recommended.
There is no charge to park visitors who require help as search and rescue costs are part of the visitor's park entrance fee. Parks Canada visitor safety specialists also manage highway avalanche control programs and publish a daily public avalanche bulletin between November and May.

Croatia
Czech Republic
The Mountain Rescue Service (Horská služba České republiky, HS ČR) of the Czech Republic provides nationwide mountain rescue operations and search and rescue operations in difficult terrains in close cooperations with the Air Rescue Service and Police of the Czech Republic. It is a part of the integrated rescue system in the Czech Republic and can be reached under the phone number 1210 (paid number) or under 112 - EU standard integrated emergency service.

France
The Gendarmerie Nationale and the Police nationale are in charge of mountain rescuing. Being a paramilitary police force with law-enforcement assignments, the gendarmerie has a wide variety of missions, mainly:

search and rescue
surveillance of mountain areas
law enforcement
prevention of accidents and safety of public
deliver expert reports before the courts
The gendarmerie employs 260 gendarmes, divided in 20 units nationwide;

15 Peloton de Gendarmerie de Haute Montagne (PGHM) sprinkled in the Alps and the Pyrénées, in addition to the islands of Réunion in the Indian Ocean and Corsica.
5 Peloton de Gendarmerie de Montagne, in the Massif central and Vosges areas.
90 per cent of interventions are made by air.
The police  Compagnie républicaine de sécurité also provides mountain search and rescue in the French Alps and Pyrenees alongside the PGHM.

Outdoor literature,"Outdoor literature is a literature genre about or involving the outdoors. Outdoor literature encompasses several different subgenres including exploration literature, adventure literature and nature writing. Another subgenre is the guide book, an early example of which was Thomas West's guide to the Lake District published in 1778. The genres can include activities such as exploration, survival, sailing, hiking, mountaineering, whitewater boating, geocaching or kayaking, or writing about nature and the environment. Travel literature is similar to outdoor literature but differs in that it does not always deal with the out-of-doors, but there is a considerable overlap between these genres, in particular with regard to long journeys.

History
Henry David Thoreau's Walden (1854) is an early and influential work. Although not entirely an outdoor work (he lived in a cabin close to civilization) he expressed the ideas of why people go out into the wilderness to camp, backpack and hike: to get away from the rush of modern society and simplify life. This was a new perspective for the time and thus Walden has had a lasting influence on most outdoor authors.

Thoreau's careful observations and devastating conclusions have rippled into time, becoming stronger as the weaknesses Thoreau noted have become more pronounced […] Events that seem to be completely unrelated to his stay at Walden Pond have been influenced by it, including the national park system, the British labour movement, the creation of India, the civil rights movement, the hippie revolution, the environmental movement, and the wilderness movement. Today, Thoreau's words are quoted with feeling by liberals, socialists, anarchists, libertarians, and conservatives alike.

Robert Louis Stevenson's Travels with a Donkey in the Cévennes (1879), about his travels in Cévennes (France), is among the first popular books to present hiking and camping as recreational activities, and tells of commissioning one of the first sleeping bags.
In the world of sailing Frank Cowper's Sailing Tours (1892–1896) and Joshua Slocum's Sailing Alone Around the World (1900) are classics of outdoor literature. 
In April 1895, Joshua Slocum set sail from Boston, Massachusetts and in  Sailing Alone Around the World, he described his departure:

I had resolved on a voyage around the world, and as the wind on the morning of April 24, 1895 was fair, at noon I weighed anchor, set sail, and filled away from Boston, where the Spray had been moored snugly all winter. […] A thrilling pulse beat high in me. My step was light on deck in the crisp air. I felt there could be no turning back, and that I was engaging in an adventure the meaning of which I thoroughly understood.
More than three years later, on June 27, 1898, he returned to Newport, Rhode Island, having circumnavigated the world, a distance of more than 46,000 miles (74,000 km).
The National Outdoor Book Award was established in 1997 as a US-based non-profit program which each year honours the best in outdoor writing and publishing.

Supplementary Leverage Ratio,"A Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) is a type of alternative investment, specifically a hedge, which is essentially a bet that more liquid capital requirements will boost demand for United States Treasury securities (i.e., government bonds).
Established in 2014 as an enhancement of the Office of Financial Research's Bank Systemic Risk Monitor  as a part of the Basel III reforms, the financial instrument was broadly used in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
They have been posited as being a minor factor in the 2025 stock market crash, when stocks and bonds did not interact in their typical inverse manner. Margin calls, i.e. demands for collateral, are suspected of having reversed some attempted SLR trades.

Data physicalization,"A data physicalization  (or simply physicalization) is a physical artefact whose geometry or material properties encode data. It has the main goals to engage people and to communicate data using computer-supported physical data representations.

History
Before the invention of computers and digital devices, the application of data physicalization already existed in ancient artifacts as a medium to represent abstract information. One example is Blombo ocher plaque which is estimated to be 70000 – 80000 years old. The geometric and iconographic shapes engraved at the surface of the artifact demonstrated the cognitive complexity of ancient humans. Moreover, since such representations were deliberately made and crafted, the evidences suggest that the geometric presentation of information is a popular methodology in the context of society. Although researchers still cannot decipher the specific type of information encoded in the artifact, there are several proposed interpretations. For example, the potential functions of the artifact are divided into four categories, categorized as ""numerical"", ""functional"", ""cognitive"", and ""social"". Later, at around 35,000 B.C, another artifact, the Lebombo bone, emerged and the encoded information became easier to read. There are around 29 distinct notches carved on the baboon fibula. It is estimated that the number of notches is closely related to the number of lunar cycles. Moreover, this early counting system was also regarded as the birth of calculation.
Right before the invention of writing, the clay token system was spread across ancient Mesopotamia. When the buyers and sellers want to make a trade, they prepare a set of tokens and seal them inside the clay envelope after impressing the shape on the surface. Such physical entity was widely used in trading, administrative documents, and agricultural settlement. Moreover, the token system is evidence of the early counting system. Each shape corresponds to a physical meaning such as the representation of ""sheep"", forming a one-to-one mapping relationship. The significance of the token is it uses physical shape to encode numerical information and it is regarded as the precursor of the early writing system. The logical reason is the two-dimension symbol would record the same information as the impression created by the clay token.
From 3000 BCE to the 17th century, a more complex visual encoding, Quipus, was developed and widely used in Andean South America. Knotted strings unrelated to quipu have also been used to record information by the ancient Chinese, Tibetans and Japanese. The ancient Inca empire used it for military and taxation purposes. The Base-10 logical-numerical system can record information based on the relative distance of knots, the color of the knots, and the type of knots. Due to the texture (cotton) of Quipus, very few of them survive. By analyzing those remaining artifacts, Erland Nordenskiöld proposed that Quipus is the only writing system used by Inca, and the information encoding technique is sophisticated and distinctive.
The idea of data physicalization become popular since the 17th century in which architects and engineers widely used such methods in civil engineering and city management. For example, from 1663 to 1867, Plan-relief model was used to visualize French territorial structure and important military units such as citadels and walled cities. Therefore, one of the functions of the Plan-relief model was to plan defense or offense. It is worth noting that the model can be categorized as a military technology and it did not encode any abstract information. The tradition of using tangible models to represent buildings and architectures still remains today.
One of the contemporary examples of data physicalization is the Galton board designed by Francis Galton who promoted the concept of Regression toward the mean. The Galton board, a very useful tool in approximating the Gaussian law of errors, consists of evenly spaced nails and vertical slats at the bottom of the board. After a large number of marbles are released, they will settle down at the bottom, forming the contour of a Bell Curve. Most marbles will agglomerate at the center (smaller deviation) with few on the edge of the board.
In 1935, three different electricity companies (e.g. Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Commonwealth Edison Company) created an electricity data physicalization model to visualize the power consumption of their customers so that the company can better forecast the upcoming power demand. The model has one short axis and one long axis. The short axis indicates ""day"", whereas the long axis spans the whole year. The viewers can gain perspective on when customers consume electricity the most during the day and how does the consumption change across different seasons. The model was built manually by cutting wooden sheets and stacked all pieces together.

History of the LED,"The history of the light-emitting diode begins with the 1906 discovery of electroluminescence from a solid state diode by Henry Joseph Round. In 1927, Russian inventor Oleg Losev created the first LED. The first practical LED was developed in 1961 by researchers at Texas Instruments. The 1970s saw the first commercial LEDs. In the early 1990s, Shuji Nakamura, Hiroshi Amano and Isamu Akasaki invented blue LEDs that were dramatically more efficient than their predecessors, bringing a new generation of bright, energy-efficient white lighting and full-color LED displays into practical use, work that won them the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physics.

Early experiments
Round, of Marconi Labs, made his discovery in 1906 while using a cat's-whisker detector and passing current through combinations of carborundum (silicon carbide) crystal. He noticed that some gave off light – the first known report of the effect of the light-emitting diode (LED). 
Round published his result in 1907 in Electrical World:

To the Editors of Electrical World:
SIRS: – During an investigation of the unsymmetrical passage of current through a contact of carborundum and other substances, a curious phenomenon was noted.  On applying a potential of 10 volts between two points on a crystal of carborundum, the crystal gave out a yellowish light.  Only one or two specimens could be found, which gave a bright glow on such a low voltage, but with 110 volts, a large number could be found to glow.  In some crystals, only edges gave the light, and others gave instead of a yellow light green, orange, or blue.  In all cases tested, the glow appears to come from the negative pole, a bright blue-green spark appearing at the positive pole.  In a single crystal, if contact is made near the center with the negative pole, and the positive pole is put in contact at any other place, only one section of the crystal will glow, and that same section, wherever the positive pole is placed.
There seems to be some connection between the above effect and the e.m.f. produced by a junction of carborundum and another conductor when heated by a direct or alternating current, but the connection may be only secondary as an obvious explanation of the e.m.f. effect is the thermoelectric one.  The writer would be glad of references to any published account of an investigation of this or any allied phenomena.
New York, N. Y.

A light-emitting diode was created, in 1927, by Russian inventor Oleg Losev, that also used silicon carbide as a semiconductor. Despite having distributed his report in Soviet, German and British scientific journals, Losev's LED found no practical use for several decades, partly due to the very inefficient light-producing properties of the semiconductor used. 

In 1936, Georges Destriau observed that electroluminescence could be produced when zinc sulphide (ZnS) powder is suspended in an insulator and an alternating electrical field is applied to it. In his publications, Destriau often referred to luminescence as Losev-Light. Destriau worked in the laboratories of Madame Marie Curie, also an early pioneer in the field of luminescence with research on radium.
Hungarian Zoltán Bay together with György Szigeti patenting a lighting device in Hungary in 1939 based on silicon carbide, with an option on boron carbide, that emitted white, yellowish white, or greenish white depending on impurities present. Kurt Lehovec, Carl Accardo, and Edward Jamgochian explained these first LEDs in 1951 using an apparatus employing SiC crystals with a current source of a battery or a pulse generator and with a comparison to a variant, pure, crystal in 1953.

Rubin Braunstein of the Radio Corporation of America reported on infrared emission from gallium arsenide (GaAs) and other semiconductor alloys in 1955. Braunstein observed infrared emission generated by simple diode structures using gallium antimonide (GaSb), GaAs, indium phosphide (InP), and silicon-germanium (SiGe) alloys at room temperature and at 77K. In 1957, Braunstein further demonstrated that the rudimentary devices could be used for non-radio communication across a short distance. As noted by Kroemer Braunstein ""...had set up a simple optical communications link: Music emerging from a record player was used via suitable electronics to modulate the forward current of a GaAs diode. The emitted light was detected by a PbS diode some distance away. This signal was fed into an audio amplifier and played back by a loudspeaker. Intercepting the beam stopped the music. We had a great deal of fun playing with this setup.""

In September 1961, while working at Texas Instruments in Dallas, Texas, James R. Biard and Gary Pittman discovered near-infrared (900 nm) light emission from a tunnel diode they had constructed on a GaAs substrate. By October 1961, they had demonstrated efficient light emission and signal coupling between a GaAs p-n junction light emitter and an electrically isolated semiconductor photodetector.

Data universalism,"Data universalism is an epistemological framework that assumes a single universal narrative of any dataset without any consideration of geographical borders and social contexts. This assumption is enabled by a generalized approach in data collection. Data are used in universal endeavours across social, political, and physical sciences unrestricted from their local source and people. Data are gathered and transformed into a mutual understanding of knowing the world which forms theories of knowledge. One of many fields of critical data studies explores the geologies and histories of data by investigating data assemblages and tracing data lineage which unfolds data histories and geographies (p. 35). This reveals intersections of data politics, praxes, and powers at play which challenges data universalism as a misguided concept.

Theoretical framework
Data are mainly sampled in rich Western countries which are considered the leaders and voices of technological developments while ignoring cultures, communities, and geographies despite its application being widespread. As the data lifecycle grows, processed small data that are grounded within big data are compiled and formed from heterogeneous sources extracted from mainstream places, forming what has come to be understood as knowledge.
As of 2022, research has not shown the origin behind universalism as a practice due to a lack of controlled data. According to cultural psychologists, democracy and universalism have a positive correlation but there are no studies that show how universalism is shaped by people's experiences and environments (p. 1). A push toward datafication has been spurred by democratically advanced Western voices and diffused across fragile democracies in the Global South with no consideration to the geopolitical context and influence powers of the data landscape in countries outside the West.  As mentioned by Cappelen et. al, obscure information is found on the epistemology of universalism, although it is argued that a lack of representative data are problematic for broad global analyses (p. 1).

Criticism
Data universalism has been critiqued by many scholars concerned about data privacy and data justice, claiming that it conceals cultural specifications and diversity. Datafication ought to be viewed through the lens of epistemic diversity and justice to achieve data obedience. So, people are encouraged to critically examine the impacts of datafication by reimagining people and places.

De-westernization
Milan and Treré have contended that datafication as a privileged practice carried by dominant Western democracies that fail to see the richness of worldviews and meanings of the South. As promoted by Global South and Indigenous scholars, data universalism mistakenly assumes data to be universal when it ought to be treated differently (p. 323). If data are extracted without an ethical foundation grounded by attitude and method, the data becomes pervasive and incompetent. Moreover, a shift from a technocentric perspective that emphasizes the human agency behind data to a data method that stimulate discussion about the repercussions of datafication requires relocating the agency. This reinforces the notions of ethics and responsibilities around the data (p. 327). A push for bottom-up data practices shifts the focus of datafication to data justice to encourage citizens of the South to participate in political agency and repel an oppressed and inequal datafication process. Negligence in abstracting knowledge from others through diversifying social and historical contexts will result in biased sampling techniques and methods in data generation. This causes skewed data to be generated leading to unequal datafication.
Also, an aggregate technique used for data processing misrepresents data in a way that shapes an aggregate value as representing an aggregated individual. This adheres to the bias factor in making the subject appear as a collective by reducing variance and limiting space of contributions (p. 192). Using an aggregate technique submits to universal normativity which situates what is considered to be universally right as a practice that does not take responsibility for the context of a specific situation nor the interpretation of norms. Similarly, the interpretation of norms are also subject to contextual interpretations. While humans operate in unique cases where information can be incomplete, agency empowers humans to assess the situation and make radical decisions in complex situations where information is obscure. Thus, assuming universal normativity will not only incapacitate one's ethical validity when making choices but may lead to questionable decisions (p. 284).

Ilha do Mel,"Ilha do Mel (English: Island of Honey) is a Brazilian island, located in the state of Paraná, 4 kilometers from the coast. Although the closest part of the mainland to the island is the city of Pontal do Paraná, Ilha do Mel belongs to the municipality of Paranaguá, 24 kilometers away.
The island is a permanent environmental conservation area, and 95% of the territory is reserved for local flora and fauna. Therefore, human presence is strictly controlled: the maximum admission is 5,000 people per day. This arrangement directly affects tourism, which is the island's main economic activity. Ilha do Mel's beaches are considered among Brazil's most beautiful. No motor vehicles of any kind can enter the island, nor can animal-drawn vehicles. There are no paved grounds, nor is there any public lighting system in operation.

History
The earliest records of human presence on the island date back about 6,000 years. Two sambaquis were discovered: deposits of organic material or limestone (such as pieces of shells) accumulated by human activity. These archaeological finds indicate the presence of humans on the island. Before Portuguese colonization, the region of Ilha do Mel was populated by an indigenous group known as carijós, from the Tupi-Guaran family. Then Europeans landed on the island and mixed with the indigenous people.
There are no sure traces of the first arrival of Europeans in Ilha do Mel, however, it is known that settlers arrived on the Island of Superagui (a geographical point very close to Ilha do Mel) in 1545. The inhabitants who settled there exploited the natural resources, fished, and cultivated plants such as banana and aipim, a local tuber species.
Over the years, the island has maintained the characteristic of being secretive and somewhat mysterious. In fact, until the 1980s, Ilha do Mel had no water system or even electricity in homes. Water came in 1985 and electric light in 1988. At first, the generator ran from seven to two in the morning. Only since 1998 did power become available 24 hours a day.

Environment
Ilha do Mel is located in the middle of the Atlantic Forest, the ecosystem originally characteristic of the Brazilian coast. Before the arrival of Portuguese colonizers, the Atlantic Forest covered 1,315,460 km², 15% of Brazil's total area. Today, only 102,012 km² remains, 7% of the original area. Ilha do Mel, however, is an example of environmental preservation. The administration of the island has been in charge of IAP (Environmental Institute of Paraná) since 1980.
Of the 2,710 hectares of total area on the island, 2,241 are protected by the Ilha do Mel Ecological Station, created by the Parana State Government in 1982. More than 338 hectares belong to the Ilha do Mel State Park. Only 120 hectares of the island (7.8 percent of the total area) are designated for human settlement. In addition, under a 2004 law, it is prohibited to construct any new buildings on the island. Only modifications in existing structures are accepted.
The law aims to preserve not only the area already protected in environmental parks but also the nature present in the area of habitation. In recent years, it has been observed that while environmental preservation areas have been kept in excellent condition, the same has not been true for areas around human settlements.

Geography
Ilha do Mel is located in the Southern Region of Brazil, at latitude 25°30'S and longitude 48°20'W, about 4 kilometers from the nearest city, Pontal do Paraná, and 24 kilometers from Paranaguá. The state capital of Paraná, Curitiba, is about 100 kilometers away. The island map is similar to number eight, however, with one part much larger than the other. The larger part contains the Ecological Station and the Fortress. There are buildings only in the regions near the coast, facing the sea. No paths are passing through this part of the island.
The smaller part, on the other hand, is the most populated part and the one that houses the most restaurants, small stores, and homes of the natives. There, some paths allow people to pass through. The two piers where boats moor are located in this section of Ilha do Mel. Encantadas is located at the far end of the island while Nova Brasília is near the isthmus, which joins the two parts of the island. The isthmus has been the subject of geological study for many years, mainly because of the fear that the erosion process will split Ilha do Mel into two different islands. There is no consensus on the future of the site. Some say it is only a matter of time until the final separation.
Other research, however, has found that the extent of the isthmus is very influential due to tides and it cannot be said when or if separation will happen.

The island is characterized by a large amount of relief. The highest point is Morro do Miguel (English: Miguel's Mountain), with 151 meters.

Periglacial lake,"A periglacial lake is a lake bordering a glacier, usually found along the fringes of large ice sheets.

Periglacial Zone
Periglaciation suggests an environment located on the margin of past glaciers. It has also been attributed to a climate with a tundra-like vegetation with a permanently frozen subsoil. Usually, the term is taken in the latter sense, but periglacial is used in the former definition when discussing periglacial lakes.
Freeze and thaw cycles influence landscapes outside areas of past glaciation. Therefore, periglacial environments are anywhere that freezing and thawing modify the landscape in a significant manner. The tundra climate or periglacial zone is just outside of glaciated areas. The processes of erosion in these glacial-peripheral zones are markedly different than present processes, therefore their effects have been noted. Areas that are too dry for glaciation to occur but that display characteristics of oversteepened slopes, solifluction slumps and cirques indicate the presence of a periglacial zone. Chief actions in these zones include solifluction and frost-shattering processes, the effects of which can be seen in the south of the Bristol Channel.

Occurrence of Periglacial Lakes through Geologic Time
Former periglacial lakes are known to have existed as early as the Cryogenian period, though many were also formed in the Pleistocene period. Environments that have supported a periglacial zone or tundra climate include Siberia, Canada, Greenland, and southern Africa. The Pleistocene period is responsible for most of the known periglacial features in Britain.

Formation of Landforms in Glaciated Highlands
Several landforms are formed in glaciated areas as the ice sheet moves between advancing when additional ice is introduced to the environment and receding due to ablation. Some landforms could be considered cases of superimposed drainage.

Language of mathematics,"The language of mathematics or mathematical language is an extension of the natural language (for example English) that is used in mathematics and in science for expressing results (scientific laws, theorems, proofs, logical deductions, etc.) with concision, precision and unambiguity.

Features
The main features of the mathematical language are the following.

Use of common words with a derived meaning, generally more specific and more precise. For example, ""or"" means ""one, the other or both"", while, in common language, ""both"" is sometimes included and sometimes not. Also, a ""line"" is straight and has zero width.
Use of common words with a meaning that is completely different from their common meaning. For example, a mathematical ring is not related to any other meaning of ""ring"". Real numbers and imaginary numbers are two sorts of numbers, none being more real or more imaginary than the others.
Use of neologisms. For example polynomial, homomorphism.
Use of symbols as words or phrases. For example, 
  
    
      
        A
        =
        B
      
    
    {\displaystyle A=B}
  
 and 
  
    
      
        ∀
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle \forall x}
  
 are respectively read as ""
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
  
 equals 
  
    
      
        B
      
    
    {\displaystyle B}
  
"" and ""for all 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  
"".
Use of formulas as part of sentences. For example: ""⁠
  
    
      
        E
        =
        m
        
          c
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle E=mc^{2}}
  
⁠represents quantitatively the mass–energy equivalence."" A formula that is not included in a sentence is generally meaningless, since the meaning of the symbols may depend on the context: in ""⁠
  
    
      
        E
        =
        m
        
          c
          
            2
          
        
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle E=mc^{2}\,}
  
⁠"", this is the context that specifies that E is the energy of a physical body, m is its mass, and c is the speed of light.
Use of phrases that cannot be decomposed into their components. In particular, adjectives do not always restrict the meaning of the corresponding noun, and may change the meaning completely. For example, most algebraic integers are not integers and integers are specific algebraic integers. So, an algebraic integer is not an integer that is algebraic.
Use of mathematical jargon that consists of phrases that are used for informal explanations or shorthands. For example, ""killing"" is often used in place of ""replacing with zero"", and this led to the use of assassinator and annihilator as technical words.

Understanding mathematical text
The consequence of these features is that a mathematical text is generally not understandable without some prerequisite knowledge. For example, the sentence ""a free module is a module that has a basis"" is perfectly correct, although it appears only as a grammatically correct nonsense, when one does not know the definitions of basis, module, and free module.
H. B. Williams, an electrophysiologist, wrote in 1927:

Now mathematics is both a body of truth and a special language, a language more carefully defined and more highly abstracted than our ordinary medium of thought and expression. Also it differs from ordinary languages in this important particular: it is subject to rules of manipulation. Once a statement is cast into mathematical form it may be manipulated in accordance with these rules and every configuration of the symbols will represent facts in harmony with and dependent on those contained in the original statement. Now this comes very close to what we conceive the action of the brain structures to be in performing intellectual acts with the symbols of ordinary language. In a sense, therefore, the mathematician has been able to perfect a device through which a part of the labor of logical thought is carried on outside the central nervous system with only that supervision which is requisite to manipulate the symbols in accordance with the rules.: 291

Boston Expressionism,"Boston Expressionism is an art movement marked by emotional directness, dark humor, social and spiritual themes, and a tendency toward figuration strong enough that Boston Figurative Expressionism is sometimes used as an alternate term to distinguish it from abstract expressionism, with which it overlapped.
Strongly influenced by German Expressionism and by the immigrant, and often Jewish, experience, the movement originated in Boston, Massachusetts, in the 1930s, continues in a third-wave form today, and flourished most markedly from  the 1950s until the 1970s. 
Most commonly associated with emotionality, and the bold color choices and expressive brushwork of painters central to the movement like Hyman Bloom, Jack Levine and Karl Zerbe, Boston Expressionism is also heavily associated with virtuoso technical skills and the revival of old master technique. The work of sculptor Harold Tovish, which spanned bronze, wood and synthetics is one example of the former, while the gold- and silverpoint found in some of Joyce Reopel's early work exemplify the latter.

Origin
Hyman Bloom and Jack Levine
Hyman Bloom and Jack Levine, both key figures in the movement, shared similar roots. Both grew up in immigrant communities: Bloom in the slums of Boston's West End and Levine in the South End. In the 1930s, having attended settlement house art classes as children, both won fine arts scholarships and trained at the Fogg Museum with Denman Ross. Both also drew on their Eastern European Jewish heritage, and were strongly influenced by the ""starkness and angst"" of German Expressionism and by then contemporary Jewish painters, such as Chagall and Soutine. Bloom tended to explore spiritual themes, while Levine was more inclined toward social commentary and dark humor, but both came to prominence in 1942 when they were included in Americans 1942: 18 Artists from 9 States, a Museum of Modern Art exhibition curated by Dorothy Miller. Soon afterward, Time magazine called Bloom ""one of the most striking of U.S. Colorists,"" and Levine won a prize at an exhibit in the Metropolitan Museum in New York. Together, they were referred to as ""the bad boys of Boston.""

Karl Zerbe
Another influential artist at the time was Karl Zerbe, a painter from Germany who had studied in Italy and whose early work had been condemned by the Nazis as ""degenerate"". Zerbe emigrated to the United States in 1934, settling in Boston where he headed the Department of Painting at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts. Zerbe helped reinvigorate the staid Boston art scene by bringing European ideas, particularly those of the German Expressionists, to Boston. He arranged for Max Beckmann and Oskar Kokoschka, among others, to lecture at the museum school.

The Early ""Boston Expressionists""
By the early 1950s, Bloom, Levine, and Zerbe and the artists they influenced had been dubbed the Boston Expressionists. Confusingly, they were also sometimes referred to as the Boston School, a name typically used to reference another, older, Boston-based group.
Each of these three artists had his own style, yet they shared certain tendencies. They did not paint directly from observation, but from memory and imagination; as Bernard Chaet put it, they favored ""the conceptual over the perceptual"". Like the Abstract Expressionists, they rejected the photographic naturalism preferred by the Nazis; and, Willem de Kooning and Jackson Pollock, who had seen Bloom's work in Americans 1942, considered Bloom ""the first Abstract Expressionist artist in America."" Yet Bloom never embraced pure abstraction and, to varying degrees, Bloom, Levine, and Zerbe also painted figuratively, which is why their school of painting, in particular, is sometimes referred to as ""Boston figurative expressionism.""
The three, like the movement as a whole, were known for their technical expertise. Like the Abstract Expressionists, they were painterly, treating the paint itself, and not just its color, as a meaningful element. Known for their experimentation with new media, they were also known for their interest in methodology through the ages, thus Zerbe, for example, helped revive the ancient Egyptian medium of encaustic, a mixture of pigment and hot wax, in the 1940s.
Chaet called Bloom the link between Boston Expressionism and Abstract Expressionism. Bloom's Christmas Tree (1945) is an example of one of his more abstract works, barely suggesting the appearance of the original object by its shape. Levine's Street Scene #2 (1938), with its hint of danger and corruption, is an example of Levine's characteristic themes and of the painterly brushwork and distorted yet skillfully rendered figures that were characteristic of Boston Expressionism.

Later Generations
Bloom, Levine, and Zerbe influenced a second generation of painters, many of them first- or second-generation Jewish immigrants, and many of them students of Zerbe's at the museum school.

Alloy,"An alloy is a mixture of chemical elements of which in most cases at least one is a metallic element, although it is also sometimes used for mixtures of elements; herein only metallic alloys are described. Metallic alloys often have properties that differ from those of the pure elements from which they are made. 
The vast majority of metals used for commercial purposes are alloyed to improve their properties or behavior, such as increased strength, hardness or corrosion resistance. Metals may also be alloyed to reduce their overall cost, for instance alloys of gold and copper.
A typical example of an alloy is 304 grade stainless steel which is commonly used for kitchen utensils, pans, knives and forks. Sometime also known as 18/8, it as an alloy consisting broadly of 74% iron, 18% chromium and 8% nickel. The chromium and nickel alloying elements add strength and hardness to the majority iron element, but their main function is to make it resistant to rust/corrosion.
In an alloy, the atoms are joined by metallic bonding rather than by covalent bonds typically found in chemical compounds. The alloy constituents are usually measured by mass percentage for practical applications, and in atomic fraction for basic science studies. Alloys are usually classified as substitutional or interstitial alloys, depending on the atomic arrangement that forms the alloy. They can be further classified as homogeneous (consisting of a single phase), or heterogeneous (consisting of two or more phases) or intermetallic. An alloy may be a solid solution of metal elements (a single phase, where all metallic grains (crystals) are of the same composition) or a mixture of metallic phases (two or more solutions, forming a microstructure of different crystals within the metal).
Examples of alloys include red gold (gold and copper), white gold (gold and silver), sterling silver (silver and copper), steel or silicon steel (iron with non-metallic carbon or silicon respectively), solder, brass, pewter, duralumin, bronze, and amalgams.
Alloys are used in a wide variety of applications, from the steel alloys, used in everything from buildings to automobiles to surgical tools, to exotic titanium alloys used in the aerospace industry, to beryllium-copper alloys for non-sparking tools.

Characteristics
An alloy is a mixture of chemical elements, which forms an impure substance (admixture) that retains the characteristics of a metal. An alloy is distinct from an impure metal in that, with an alloy, the added elements are well controlled to produce desirable properties, while impure metals such as wrought iron are less controlled, but are often considered useful. Alloys are made by mixing two or more elements, at least one of which is a metal. This is usually called the primary metal or the base metal, and the name of this metal may also be the name of the alloy. The other constituents may or may not be metals but, when mixed with the molten base, they will be soluble and dissolve into the mixture.
The mechanical properties of alloys will often be quite different from those of its individual constituents. A metal that is normally very soft (malleable), such as aluminium, can be altered by alloying it with another soft metal, such as copper. Although both metals are very soft and ductile, the resulting aluminium alloy will have much greater strength. Adding a small amount of non-metallic carbon to iron trades its great ductility for the greater strength of an alloy called steel. Due to its very-high strength, but still substantial toughness, and its ability to be greatly altered by heat treatment, steel is one of the most useful and common alloys in modern use. By adding chromium to steel, its resistance to corrosion can be enhanced, creating stainless steel, while adding silicon will alter its electrical characteristics, producing silicon steel.

Like oil and water, a molten metal may not always mix with another element. For example, pure iron is almost completely insoluble with copper. Even when the constituents are soluble, each will usually have a saturation point, beyond which no more of the constituent can be added. Iron, for example, can hold a maximum of 6.67% carbon. Although the elements of an alloy usually must be soluble in the liquid state, they may not always be soluble in the solid state. If the metals remain soluble when solid, the alloy forms a solid solution, becoming a homogeneous structure consisting of identical crystals, called a phase. If as the mixture cools the constituents become insoluble, they may separate to form two or more different types of crystals, creating a heterogeneous microstructure of different phases, some with more of one constituent than the other. However, in other alloys, the insoluble elements may not separate until after crystallization occurs. If cooled very quickly, they first crystallize as a homogeneous phase, but they are supersaturated with the secondary constituents.

HUN-REN Wigner Research Centre for Physics,"The HUN-REN Wigner Research Centre for Physics  is the largest Hungarian research institute studying physics.Formerly a research institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, it became a member of the Eötvös Loránd Research Network  and after the ELKH's reorganisation it became part of the HUN-REN Hungarian Research Network. The Wigner Research Centre was established in 2012 by the merger of the MTA KFKI Institute for Particle and Nuclear Physics and the MTA Institute for Solid State Physics and Optics, and takes the name of the Nobel Prize winning physicist Eugene Wigner. The research centre has two institutes, the Wigner Institute for Particle and Nuclear Physics  and the Wigner Institute for Solid State Physics and Optics.

History
The predecessor of the research centre was the Central Research Institute of Physics of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences , founded in 1950. Originally established with two departments, the institute was soon expanded by several departments under the leadership of researchers such as Károly Simonyi and Lajos Jánossy. According to the preparatory committee, its aim was ""to raise Hungarian physics research from its present state, which is far behind that of other disciplines, and to enable productive scientific research in all fields of physics which are of primary importance for the development and application of science"". From the very beginning, KFKI has been the home to a wide variety of research, and Wigner FK is no different. The direct or indirect exploitation of results has always been a feature. Physics was not the only field at the institute, but also various technical and even life sciences. After the change of regime, the KFKI was dissolved in 1992. and its scientific institutes were given full autonomy within the MTA.
Subsequently, the MTA Wigner Research Centre for Physics  was established on 1 January 2012 by the merger of the former MTA KFKI Institute for Particle and Nuclear Physics and the former MTA Institute for Solid State Physics and Optics. Since 2013, the Wigner Data Centre has been part of the Research Centre. From 1 September 2019, the Wigner RCP has been under the management of the Eötvös Loránd Research Network , and continues to operate as an MTA Institute of excellence, today one of the largest research institutes for physics at the HUN-REN. The main research areas are: quantum technology, experimental and theoretical particle physics, nuclear physics, general relativity and gravity, fusion plasma physics, space physics, nuclear materials science, experimental and theoretical solid-state physics, statistical physics, atomic physics, optics and materials science. Wigner RCP is also part of many international collaborations, experiments and projects, such as ALICE Experiment, CMS, Na61  or EuPRAXIA

Organizational structure
Institute for Particle and Nuclear Physics
The Institute of Particle and Nuclear Physics conducts successful experimental and theoretical exploratory research in the fields of particle physics, nuclear physics, gravitational research, space physics, nuclear solid-state physics and materials science, as well as computational sciences.

Institute of Solid State Physics and Optics
The Institute of Solid State Physics and Optics is engaged in research and development of atomic-level material structure, quantum physics, quantum optics, statistical physics and laser applications. The main profile of its research groups are experimental research in local laboratories and performing computationally intensive numerical simulations.

Wigner Data Centre
The Wigner Data Centre is a server infrastructure. Since 2013, the Wigner Data Centre has housed CERN's remote Tier-0 infrastructure, thus playing a key role in processing the data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Following the completion of the CERN project, the reconstruction of hardware elements and redesign of software components led to the establishment of WSCLAB (Wigner Scientific Computing Laboratory), which houses the GPULAB servers, the Virgo research project, the Tier-2 cluster operated for CERN's ALICE and CMS detectors, and the infrastructure of the Wigner ALICE Analysis Facility. The Wigner Data Center now participate in the development and operation of the HUN-REN Cloud Service, as well as in the HUN-REN Data Repository Project on behalf of the HUN-REN Wigner RCP. Among the prizes donated by Wigner RCP are the Zimányi Medal (RMI) and the Gribov Medal (RMI)

Geohumanities,"Geohumanities, sometimes written GeoHumanities or The GeoHumanities is a term has been used with varied meanings to describe areas of academic study.

The book GeoHumanities: Art, History, Text at the Edge of Place was published in 2011 edited by Michael Dear and others, and ""explores the humanities' rapidly expanding engagement with geography, and the multi-methodological inquiries that analyze the meanings of place, and then reconstructs those meanings to provoke new knowledge as well as the possibility of altered political practices."" A reviewer in Time + Space described it as ""a terrific introduction to a segment of interdisciplinary studies which seems to be on the verge of explosion"", while the reviewer for the Annals of the American Association of Geographers said: The contribution of the book lies in its ""breaching"" (as the editors put it) of the conventional boundaries between geography and the humanities rather than the conventional liberal-arts-college sense of a set of discrete fields engaging with one another for mutual benefit. It is, if you like,  trans- rather than interdisciplinary.
The GeoHumanities Special Interest Group of the Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations was established in 2013, focussing on ""geospatial and spatial-temporal perspectives in the digital humanities"".
The journal Geohumanities has been published since 2015 by the American Association of Geographers, and ""span[s] conceptual and methodological debates in geography and the humanities; critical reflections on analog and digital artistic productions; and new scholarly interactions occurring at the intersections of geography and multiple humanities disciplines"".

The Centre for the GeoHumanities of Royal Holloway, University of London (established in or before 2016) describes itself as a major initiative linking arts and humanities scholars and practitioners, geographers and the creative, cultural and heritage sectors. It showcases and fosters work with an arts and humanities orientation on issues that have a strong geographical resonance, such as space, place, landscape and environment.
and states: The GeoHumanities also have a longer intellectual history rooted in the pre-disciplinary origins of Geography as ‘earth writing’. Geography has never been the exclusive preserve of geographers and has always posed a challenge to modern disciplinary thinking. 
As of April 2025 the word geohumanitities does not appear in the online Oxford English Dictionary.

Precordillera,"Precordillera is a Spanish geographical term for hills and mountains lying before a greater range, similar to foothills. The term is derived from cordillera (mountain range)—literally ""pre-mountain range""—and applied usually to the Andes.
Some places usually called precordillera are:

Andean mountains east of the main ranges of Andes in Argentina. It is separated from the much higher Frontal Cordillera to the west by Uspallata Valley in Argentina. Precordillera mountains reach around 3,000 m a.s.l. in Sierras de Villavicencio.
Used all over Chile from north to south as a morphological unit lying just between the Andes and the Intermediate Depression.

Spatial mismatch,"Spatial mismatch is the mismatch between where low-income households reside and suitable job opportunities. In its original formulation (see below) and in subsequent research, it has mostly been understood as a phenomenon affecting African-Americans, as a result of residential segregation, economic restructuring, and the suburbanization of employment.
Spatial mismatch was first proposed by John F. Kain, following the theory of John Meyer, in a seminal 1968 article, ""Housing Segregation, Negro Employment, and Metropolitan Decentralization"". That article did not specifically use the term ""spatial mismatch"", and Kain disclaimed credit. 
In 1987, William Julius Wilson was an important exponent, elaborating the role of economic restructuring, as well as the departure of the black middle-class, in the development of a ghetto underclass in the United States.

History
After World War I, many wealthy Americans started decentralizing out of the cities and into the suburbs. During the second half of the 20th century, department stores followed the trend of moving into the suburbs. In 1968, Kain formulated the “Spatial Mismatch Hypothesis”, but he did not refer to it by this term. His hypothesis was that black workers reside in segregated zones that are distant and poorly connected to major centers of growth. The phenomenon has many implications for inner-city residents dependent on low-level entry jobs. For example, distance from work centers can lead to increasing unemployment rates and further dampen poverty outcomes for the region at large. Since its conceptualization in the late 1960s, the spatial mismatch hypothesis has been widely cited to explain the economic problems encountered by inner-city minorities.

Factors
In 2007, Laurent Gobillon, Harris Selod, and Yves Zenou suggested that there are seven different factors that support the spatial mismatch phenomenon. Four factors are attributed to potential workers accessibility and initiatives. The remaining three factors stress employers' reluctance to divert away from the negative stigma of city people and in particular minorities when hiring.

Potential workers perspectives
Commuting cost is seen as an obstacle for inner-city people to be present for job interviews and furthermore to arrive to work everyday on time. In other words, cars may be too expensive for some workers and they may have to rely heavily on public transportation. Public transportation is problematic in a sense that it is not always prompt and may not stop at all job location sites.
Information access to jobs decreases as distance increases away from the job center. People who are living away from the job center are generally less knowledgeable about potential openings than individuals who live closer to the job center. Therefore, networking and information spillovers are of a major advantage in accessing information about potential openings.
There seems to be a lack of incentive for distance workers to search intensively for a job that is relatively far away. Gobillion, Selod and Zenou believe that minorities, more or less, do a tradeoff between short-term loss and long-term benefits. The short term loss involves making frequent search trips to distant work centers. However, the long-term benefit involves obtaining a stable job and thus a higher wage rate. Unfortunately, minorities tend to weigh the short-term loss higher than the long-term benefits and as a result, decrease their opportunity at obtaining a job in the suburbs.
There also seems to be a high search cost involve for urban workers looking for a job in the suburbs. It might be associated with paying a job agency to expand their search beyond the urban residential area or locating an agency in the suburbs.

China
Growth of ghost cities in China, mostly from not yet agglomerated areas between or adjacent metropolitan areas or coal mining towns, as in the case of the most famous example, Kangbashi New Area of Ordos, are an example of spatial mismatch.  In the case of places near metropolitan areas, it represents less of a risk going forward than in mining areas.

Indian subcontinent,"The Indian subcontinent is a physiographic region of Asia below the Himalayas which projects into the Indian Ocean between the Bay of Bengal to the east and the Arabian Sea to the west. It is now divided between Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan.  Although the terms ""Indian subcontinent"" and ""South Asia"" are often also used interchangeably to denote a wider region which includes, in addition, Bhutan, the Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka, the ""Indian subcontinent"" is more of a geophysical term, whereas ""South Asia"" is more geopolitical.  ""South Asia"" frequently also includes Afghanistan, which is not  considered part of the subcontinent even in extended usage.

Name
Historically, the region surrounding and southeast of the Indus River was often simply referred to as ""India"" in many historical sources. Even today, historians use this term to denote the entire Indian subcontinent when discussing history up until the era of the British Raj. Over time, however, ""India"" evolved to refer to a distinct political entity that eventually became a nation-state (today the Republic of India).
According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the term subcontinent signifies a ""subdivision of a continent which has a distinct geographical, political, or cultural identity"" and also a ""large land mass somewhat smaller than a continent"". Its use to signify the Indian subcontinent is evidenced from the early twentieth century when most of the territory was either part of the British Empire or allied with them. It was a convenient term to refer to the region comprising both British India and the princely states.
The term has been particularly common in the British Empire and its successors, while the term South Asia is the more common usage in Europe and North America as well as in most countries in South Asia itself sometimes. According to historians Sugata Bose and Ayesha Jalal, the Indian subcontinent has come to be known as South Asia ""in more recent and neutral parlance"". Indologist Ronald B. Inden argues that the usage of the term South Asia is becoming more widespread since it clearly distinguishes the region from East Asia. While South Asia, a more accurate term that reflects the region's contemporary political demarcations, is replacing the Indian subcontinent, a term closely linked to the region's colonial heritage, as a cover term, the latter is still widely used in typological studies.
Since the Partition of India, citizens of Pakistan (which became independent of British India in 1947) and Bangladesh (which became independent of Pakistan in 1971) often perceive the use of the Indian subcontinent as offensive and suspicious because of the dominant placement of India in the term. As such it is being increasingly less used in those countries. Meanwhile, many Indian analysts prefer to use the term because of the socio-cultural commonalities of the region. The region has also been called the ""Asian subcontinent"", the ""South Asian subcontinent"", as well as ""India"" or ""Greater India"" in the classical and pre-modern sense.
The sport of cricket, introduced to the region by the  British, is notably popular in India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bangladesh. Within a cricket context, these countries are sometimes referred to simply as the subcontinent e.g. ""Australia's tour of the subcontinent"". The term is also sometimes used adjectivally in cricket e.g. ""subcontinental conditions"".

Geology
Before the Indian plate rifted from Gondwana and drifted northward toward Eurasia, two other landmasses, the Qiangtang terrane and Lhasa terrane, had accreted to Eurasia.  The Qiantang and Lhasa terranes were part of the string of microcontinents Cimmeria, today constituting parts of Turkey, Iran, Pakistan (including the Karakoram), China, Myanmar, Thailand and Malaysia, which closed the Paleo-Tethys Ocean above them and opening the Neo-Tethys Ocean between them and Gondwana, eventually colliding with Eurasia, and creating the Cimmerian Orogeny.  
After the Lhasa terrane had adjoined Eurasia, an active continental margin opened along its southern flank, below which the Neo-Tethys oceanic plate had begun to subduct. Magmatic activity along this flank produced the Gangdese batholith in what is today the Tibetan trans-Himalaya. Another subduction zone opened to the west, in the ocean basin above the Kohistan-Ladakh island arc. This island arc—formed by one oceanic plate subducting beneath another, its magma rising and creating continental crust—drifted north, closed its ocean basin and collided with Eurasia.  Ladakh is today in the Indian-administered region of Kashmir and Kohistan in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan, both on the Indian subcontinent. 
The collision of India with Eurasia closed the Neo-Tethys Ocean. The suture zone (in this instance, the remnants of the Neo-Tethys subduction zone pinched between the two continental crusts), which marks India's welding to Eurasia, is called the Indus-Yarlung suture zone. It lies north of the ",Continents,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_subcontinent,1,indian subcontinent physiographic region asia himalaya project indian ocean bay bengal east arabian sea west divided bangladesh india pakistan although term indian subcontinent south asia often also used interchangeably denote wider region includes addition bhutan maldives nepal sri lanka indian subcontinent geophysical term whereas south asia geopolitical south asia frequently also includes afghanistan considered part subcontinent even extended usage name historically region surrounding southeast indus river often simply referred india many historical source even today historian use term denote entire indian subcontinent discussing history era british raj time however india evolved refer distinct political entity eventually became nationstate today republic india according oxford english dictionary term subcontinent signifies subdivision continent distinct geographical political cultural identity also large land mass somewhat smaller continent use signify indian subcontinent evidenced early twentieth century territory either part british empire allied convenient term refer region comprising british india princely state term particularly common british empire successor term south asia common usage europe north america well country south asia sometimes according historian sugata bose ayesha jalal indian subcontinent come known south asia recent neutral parlance indologist ronald b inden argues usage term south asia becoming widespread since clearly distinguishes region east asia south asia accurate term reflects region contemporary political demarcation replacing indian subcontinent term closely linked region colonial heritage cover term latter still widely used typological study since partition india citizen pakistan became independent british india bangladesh became independent pakistan often perceive use indian subcontinent offensive suspicious dominant placement india term increasingly less used country meanwhile many indian analyst prefer use term sociocultural commonality region region also called asian subcontinent south asian subcontinent well india greater india classical premodern sense sport cricket introduced region british notably popular india pakistan sri lanka nepal bangladesh within cricket context country sometimes referred simply subcontinent eg australia tour subcontinent term also sometimes used adjectivally cricket eg subcontinental condition geology indian plate rifted gondwana drifted northward toward eurasia two landmass qiangtang terrane lhasa terrane accreted eurasia qiantang lhasa terranes part string microcontinents cimmeria today constituting part turkey iran pakistan including karakoram china myanmar thailand malaysia closed paleotethys ocean opening neotethys ocean gondwana eventually colliding eurasia creating cimmerian orogeny lhasa terrane adjoined eurasia active continental margin opened along southern flank neotethys oceanic plate begun subduct magmatic activity along flank produced gangdese batholith today tibetan transhimalaya another subduction zone opened west ocean basin kohistanladakh island arc island arc—formed one oceanic plate subducting beneath another magma rising creating continental crust—drifted north closed ocean basin collided eurasia ladakh today indianadministered region kashmir kohistan khyberpakhtunkhwa province pakistan indian subcontinent collision india eurasia closed neotethys ocean suture zone instance remnant neotethys subduction zone pinched two continental crust mark india welding eurasia called indusyarlung suture zone lie north
Marine Day,"Marine Day (海の日, Umi no Hi), also known as ""Ocean Day"" or ""Sea Day"", is a public holiday in Japan usually celebrated on the third Monday in July. The purpose of the holiday is to give thanks for the ocean's bounty and to consider the importance of the ocean to Japan as a maritime nation.
Many people take advantage of the holiday and summer weather to take a beach trip. Other ocean-related festivities are observed as well. The date roughly coincides with the end of the rainy season (梅雨 tsuyu) in much of the Japanese mainland.
In 2020, the holiday was observed on Thursday, July 23, a one-time move that was made as a special accommodation to support the opening of the Tokyo Olympics. Due to the postponement of the Olympics, the 2021 date was moved to July 22, also on Thursday as a one-time holiday.

History
The day was known as Marine Memorial Day (海の記念日, umi no kinen bi) until 1996. Communications Minister Shōzō Murata designated the day in 1941 to commemorate the Meiji Emperor and his 1876 voyage in the Meiji Maru, an iron steamship constructed in Scotland in 1874. The voyage included a trip around the Tōhoku region, embarking on a lighthouse boat in Aomori, and a brief stop in Hakodate before returning to Yokohama on July 20 of that year. However, it was not designated a national holiday until 1995, when it became the first holiday in the summer months.
First observed on July 20, 1996, the Happy Monday System legislation moved the date to the third Monday of July beginning in 2003.
As special arrangement for the 2020 Summer Olympics, the 2020 date for Marine Day was moved to July 23. With the Olympics and Paralympics postponed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the government left this change in place for 2020 and passed an amendment to the Olympic and Paralympic Special Measures Act to make a corresponding change to the holiday in 2021.

Celebration
On this day, families may visit beaches such as Isshiki Beach in Hayama and swim, snorkel, surf, or dive. People may also participate in an event called 'mud-ball throwing'. National aquariums also host special water-related events on this day.

Estuarine turbidity maximum,"An estuarine turbidity maximum, or ETM, is the zone of highest turbidity resulting from turbulent resuspension of sediment and flocculation of particulate matter in an estuary. The turbulence is driven by tidal forces, waves, and density-drive currents that push a salt wedge upstream and beneath outflowing freshwater discharge.

Central Indo-Pacific,"The Central Indo-Pacific is a biogeographic region of Earth's seas, comprising the tropical waters of the western Pacific Ocean, the eastern Indian Ocean, and the connecting seas.
The Central Indo-Pacific is a part of the larger Indo-Pacific, which includes the tropical Indian Ocean, the western and central tropical Pacific Ocean, and the seas connecting the two in the general area of Indonesia. The Central Indo-Pacific may be classified as a marine realm, one of the great biogeographic divisions of the world's ocean basins, or as a subrealm of the Indo-Pacific.
The Central Indo-Pacific realm covers eastern shores of the tropical Indian Ocean, including most of the Indian Ocean coast of the Indonesian archipelago, the northern Australian coast, and the Cocos and Christmas islands. It extends through the tropical seas connecting the Pacific and Indian oceans, including the Java Sea in central Indonesia, the South China Sea between the Asian mainland and the Philippine and Malay archipelagos, and the Arafura Sea separating Australia and New Guinea. It includes the seas surrounding island groups of the western Pacific, including the Ryukyu Islands, Caroline Islands, Marianas Islands, New Guinea and the Bismarck Archipelago, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, New Caledonia, Fiji, Tonga, and Lord Howe Island.
It is bounded on the west by the Western Indo-Pacific, with the transition at the Strait of Malacca and in southern Sumatra. The Central Indo-Pacific includes the seas surrounding the northern half of Australia, while the Temperate Australasia marine realm includes the seas surrounding the southern half of Australia. The boundaries between those two marine realms lie in Western Australia and southern Queensland. The Eastern Indo-Pacific lies to the east, extending across most of tropical Polynesia. To the north, the Taiwan Strait forms the boundary with the Temperate Northern Pacific, which also includes the larger Japanese islands.
The Central Indo-Pacific includes the Coral Triangle region, which has the greatest diversity of tropical coral reef species in the world. The Coral Triangle has 605 tropical coral species, including 15 endemic species, about 76% of the world's total (798 species). The Coral Triangle has 2,228 species of reef fishes, of which 235 (7.8%) are endemic, about 37% of the world total (6000 species). It includes the largest and second-largest coral formations in the world, Australia's Great Barrier Reef and the New Caledonia Barrier Reef.

Netflix,"Netflix is an American subscription video on-demand over-the-top streaming service. The service primarily distributes original and acquired films and television shows from various genres, and it is available internationally in multiple languages.
Launched in 2007, nearly a decade after Netflix, Inc. began its pioneering DVD-by-mail movie rental service, Netflix is the most-subscribed video on demand streaming media service, with 301.6 million paid memberships in more than 190 countries as of 2025. By 2022, ""Netflix Original"" productions accounted for half of its library in the United States and the namesake company had ventured into other categories, such as video game publishing of mobile games through its flagship service. As of 2025, Netflix is the 18th most-visited website in the world, with 21.18% of its traffic coming from the United States, followed by the United Kingdom at 6.01%, Canada at 4.94%, and Brazil at 4.24%.

History
Launch as a mail-based rental business (1997–2006)
Netflix was founded by Marc Randolph and Reed Hastings on August 29, 1997, in Scotts Valley, California. Hastings, a computer scientist and mathematician, was a co-founder of Pure Software, which was acquired by Rational Software that year for $750 million, the then biggest acquisition in Silicon Valley history. Randolph had worked as a marketing director for Pure Software after Pure Atria acquired a company where Randolph worked. He was previously a co-founder of MicroWarehouse, a computer mail-order company, as well as vice president of marketing for Borland.
Hastings and Randolph came up with the idea for Netflix while carpooling between their homes in Santa Cruz, California, and Pure Atria's headquarters in Sunnyvale. Patty McCord, later head of human resources at Netflix, was also in the carpool group. Randolph admired Amazon and wanted to find a large category of portable items to sell over the Internet using a similar model. Hastings and Randolph considered and rejected selling and renting VHS as too expensive to stock and too delicate to ship. When they heard about DVDs, first introduced in the United States in early 1997, they tested the concept of online DVD rental or sales by mail, by mailing a compact disc to Hastings's house in Santa Cruz. When the CD arrived intact, they decided to enter the $16 billion Home-video sales and rental industry. (Hastings is often quoted saying that he decided to start Netflix after being fined $40 at a Blockbuster store for returning late a copy of Apollo 13, but Randolph later said that Hastings invented the anecdote. Blockbuster reportedly ordered Hastings in the mid-2000s to stop telling the story, after it could not find such a transaction in its records.) Hastings invested $2.5 million into Netflix from the sale of Pure Atria. Netflix launched as the first DVD rental and sales website with 30 employees and 925 titles available—nearly all DVDs published. Randolph and Hastings met with Jeff Bezos, whose Amazon offered to acquire Netflix for between $14 and $16 million. Fearing competition from Amazon, Randolph thought the offer was fair, but Hastings, who owned 70% of the company, turned it down on the plane ride home.
Not restricted to the size of a retail store, Netflix could offer hundreds of thousands of DVDs to customers in a long tail business model. Early employee Cindy Holland compared the company acquiring DVDs to ""shoveling coal in the side door of the house"". Initially, Netflix offered a per-rental model for each DVD but introduced a monthly subscription concept in September 1999. The per-rental model was dropped by early 2000, allowing the company to focus on the business model of flat-fee unlimited rentals without due dates, late fees, shipping and handling fees, or per-title rental fees. While customers enjoyed the convenience, more important to Netflix was that it did not have to store or ship those DVDs; subscribers' homes acted as warehouses. The company secretly slowed deliveries to heavy users (""pigs""), to discourage them from quickly returning DVDs.
In September 2000, during the dot-com bubble, while Netflix was suffering losses, Hastings and Randolph offered to sell the company to Blockbuster for $50 million. John Antioco, CEO of Blockbuster, thought the offer was a joke and declined, saying, ""The dot-com hysteria is completely overblown."" While Netflix experienced fast growth in early 2001, the continued effects of the dot-com bubble collapse and the September 11 attacks caused the company to hold off plans for its initial public offering (IPO) and to lay off one-third of its 120 employees.

DVD players were a popular gift for holiday sales in late 2001, and demand for DVD subscription services were ""growing like crazy"", according to chief talent officer McCord. The company went public on May 23, 2002, opening on NASDAQ at US$15.00 per share with a sale of 5.5 million shares of common stock.

2021 Netflix walkout,"The 2021 Netflix walkout was a labor dispute involving a number of workers at American streaming and production company Netflix in late 2021. After several workers spoke out against The Closer, a controversial stand-up comedy created by Dave Chappelle special released by Netflix, the company's response sparked further controversy, leading to a walkout organized by the Netflix trans employee resource group.

Background
During the four-year period of 2017–2020, GLAAD's annual Studio Responsibility Index found that major studios had produced no films with transgender or nonbinary characters. In 2012, GLAAD reviewed 102 episodes and storylines of scripted television containing transgender characters, finding that ""54% of those were categorized as containing negative representations at the time of their airing"" while another 35% ranged from ""problematic"" to ""good,"" with only 12% considered ""groundbreaking, fair and accurate"" to such an extent that they could win a GLAAD Media Award.
Research has found that viewing multiple transgender TV characters and stories improves viewers' attitudes toward transgender people and related policies.

The Closer controversy
The Closer is a 2021 stand-up comedy special written and performed by Dave Chappelle for Netflix. In the special, released on October 5, 2021, Chappelle has segments that joke about the discrimination against the African-American community relative to the discrimination against the LGBTQ community, including one where he states that he is ""Team TERF."" The special sparked controversy, receiving heavy criticism for the comments perceived as transphobic and racist. GLAAD issued a statement saying that Chappelle's ""brand has become synonymous with ridiculing trans people and other marginalized communities."" David Johns, the executive director of the National Black Justice Coalition, released a statement asking Netflix to remove The Closer from its service, saying that ""[p]erpetuating transphobia perpetuates violence.""

Labor dispute and walkout
On October 7, Netflix suspended Terra Field, a trans employee, after she posted a Twitter thread stating that ""we launched another Chappelle special where he attacks the trans community, and the very validity of transness – all while trying to pit us against other marginalized groups"" which went viral. Netflix alleged that Field, as well as two other employees, had attempted to gain access to a director-level meeting without permission. Dear White People writer Jaclyn Moore additionally announced that she would no longer collaborate with Netflix, stating the company continues to ""put out and profit from blatantly and dangerously homophobic content.""
On October 8, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos defended the special's release in a memo sent to employees, saying that ""[w]e don't allow titles on Netflix that are designed to incite hate or violence, and we don't believe The Closer crosses that line.""
Following Sarandos' statement, the trans employee resource group at Netflix announced they would stage a walkout on October 20, stating in a message that the streaming company had failed them ""by repeatedly releasing content that harms the Trans community and continually failing to create content that represents and uplifts Trans content."" That day, Field and the two other employees who had been suspended were reinstated.
Soon after the employee resource group's threat of a walkout, Sarandos defended the special once again in a company-wide email saying ""[w]ith The Closer, we understand that the concern is not about offensive-to-some content but titles which could increase real world harm (such as further marginalizing already marginalized groups, hate, violence etc.)"" and that ""[w]hile some employees disagree, we have a strong belief that content on screen doesn't directly translate to real-world harm"". On October 15, it was reported that Netflix had fired one of the lead organizers of the walkout, a Black trans person who is pregnant, allegedly for leaking nonpublic financial information to Bloomberg News.
On October 18, the Trans Employee Resource Group within Netflix released a list of changes they wanted to see the company make, including:

The creation of a fund to develop trans and non-binary talent
An increase in investment in trans and non-binary content
A review of internal procedure on commissioning potentially sensitive content
Hiring more trans and non-binary, especially BIPOC, content executives
Allowing employees to remove themselves out of previous advertisements the employees had participated in
Getting rid of workplace references to transphobic content (such as posters in offices)
An acknowledgement of Netflix's responsibility for harm its content causes
The additional of disclaimers to content that contains discriminatory portrayals
On October 19, Sarandos stated in an interview with Variety that there was ""a group of employees who were definitely feeling pain and hurt from a decision we made"" and that his internal",Netflix,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Netflix_walkout,0,netflix walkout labor dispute involving number worker american streaming production company netflix late several worker spoke closer controversial standup comedy created dave chappelle special released netflix company response sparked controversy leading walkout organized netflix trans employee resource group background fouryear period – glaads annual studio responsibility index found major studio produced film transgender nonbinary character glaad reviewed episode storyline scripted television containing transgender character finding categorized containing negative representation time airing another ranged problematic good considered groundbreaking fair accurate extent could win glaad medium award research found viewing multiple transgender tv character story improves viewer attitude toward transgender people related policy closer controversy closer standup comedy special written performed dave chappelle netflix special released october chappelle segment joke discrimination africanamerican community relative discrimination lgbtq community including one state team terf special sparked controversy receiving heavy criticism comment perceived transphobic racist glaad issued statement saying chappelles brand become synonymous ridiculing trans people marginalized community david john executive director national black justice coalition released statement asking netflix remove closer service saying perpetuating transphobia perpetuates violence labor dispute walkout october netflix suspended terra field trans employee posted twitter thread stating launched another chappelle special attack trans community validity transness – trying pit u marginalized group went viral netflix alleged field well two employee attempted gain access directorlevel meeting without permission dear white people writer jaclyn moore additionally announced would longer collaborate netflix stating company continues put profit blatantly dangerously homophobic content october netflix coceo ted sarandos defended special release memo sent employee saying dont allow title netflix designed incite hate violence dont believe closer cross line following sarandos statement trans employee resource group netflix announced would stage walkout october stating message streaming company failed repeatedly releasing content harm trans community continually failing create content represents uplift trans content day field two employee suspended reinstated soon employee resource group threat walkout sarandos defended special companywide email saying closer understand concern offensivetosome content title could increase real world harm marginalizing already marginalized group hate violence etc employee disagree strong belief content screen doesnt directly translate realworld harm october reported netflix fired one lead organizer walkout black trans person pregnant allegedly leaking nonpublic financial information bloomberg news october trans employee resource group within netflix released list change wanted see company make including creation fund develop trans nonbinary talent increase investment trans nonbinary content review internal procedure commissioning potentially sensitive content hiring trans nonbinary especially bipoc content executive allowing employee remove previous advertisement employee participated getting rid workplace reference transphobic content poster office acknowledgement netflixs responsibility harm content cause additional disclaimer content contains discriminatory portrayal october sarandos stated interview variety group employee definitely feeling pain hurt decision made internal
Netflix and LGBTQ representation in animation,"Netflix has contributed substantially to LGBTQ representation in animation. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, pansexual, asexual and transgender characters have appeared in various animated series, and some animated films, on the streaming platform. GLAAD described Netflix as a company taking ""impressive strides in viewership and impact,"" when it came to LGBTQ representation. Scholars have stated that LGBTQ characters on streaming services, such as Netflix, ""made more displays of affection"" than on broadcast networks.

Popularity of series
Before December 2023, Netflix had not released viewership numbers for its entire catalog, and only for select series and films. Even so, some described She-Ra and the Princesses of Power as ""popular"" or an ""in-demand show"" and Bojack Horseman as ""successful"". GLAAD continually praised Netflix for having the highest number of ""LGBTQ regular and recurring characters,"" Some scholarship said that the streaming service, like Hulu and Amazon, caters to ""niche audiences"" and had more ""displays of affection"" than broadcast television.

Cancellations and endings
Netflix has cancelled some shows with LGBTQ+ characters over the years, such as Tuca & Bertie, Q-Force, Hoops, BoJack Horseman, and Dead End: Paranormal Park.
In July 2019, it was revealed the streaming service was cancelling Tuca & Bertie despite ""rave reviews,"" with creator Lisa Hanawalt blaming it on the service's algorithm not showing the show to the right audience, and said she hoped the show could find a new ""home"". The series later was picked by Adult Swim for a second season. Julia Alexander of The Verge, in describing the cancellation, stated that Netflix had become a ""sea of content"" and that shows were competing to find viewers while ""the streamer’s biggest projects received top billing on the homepage.""
In September 2019, Netflix announced that BoJack Horseman was cancelled, and that the final season would air in January 2020. In fall 2019, BoJack Horseman creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg made clear his disappointment at the cancellation, saying that at the previous model of the streaming service ""was to give shows time to build,"" lamented that it was ""a shame...they seem to have moved away from that model,"" but added that if his series had premiered on another network or at another time, they would not have ""gotten the second season"" and says they got ""lucky."" He also told Vulture that he was ""amazed"" the series had got that far, and that Netflix ""got to do what’s right for them"" in regard to Netflix's cancellation of the series.

In September 2019, due to the abrupt ending of Twelve Forever, Shadi Petosky, one of the executive producers, stated they will not be able to further explore protagonist Reggie Abbott as a ""canon queer"" character. Elsewhere, Petosky described Reggie as a queer character ""coming to terms with her sexuality"".
On December 8, 2020, Netflix canceled Hoops after one season. The series included a gay character named Scott on the school's basketball team.
On June 27, 2022, it was announced that Netflix cancelled Q-Force, an animated series about a group of LGBTQ superspies, after one season. Some described the cancellation as among ""major losses for queer storytelling on television"" and predicted a Peacock revival may be possible.
On January 13, 2023, Hamish Steele, creator of Dead End: Paranormal Park announced that Netflix had cancelled the series. Previously, Steele said he was grateful for showrunners who fought for LGBTQ characters in their shows, adding that there was ""absolutely no pushback from Netflix about representation,"" while describing Barney as a trans male character.

Representation
Animated series on Netflix have featured LGBTQ+ characters. Some praised depiction of asexuality lesbianism and homosexuality in BoJack Horseman. Others praised Rachel Bighead as a trans female character in Rocko's Modern Life: Static Cling, which was released in August 2019. The work was a TV movie and sequel to their 1993 series Rocko's Modern Life and the producers worked with GLAAD to ensure that the story of Rachel, as well as a plotline involving her coming out to her parents, Ed and Bev Bighead, was respectful to the LGBTQ+ community and fit within the show itself.

In May 2020, ND Stevenson, the showrunner of She-Ra and the Princesses of Power stated that while the romantic relationship between Adora and Catra was planned from the show's conception, they were not sure how overt he could portray it. But throughout each release of the show's subsequent seasons, Stevenson would lay enough groundwork for the approval of the romance. By the time the final season had aired, Stevenson expressed that he was glad that he could finally talk about it, noting that the relationship between Adora and Catra was central to the final season and written in a ""very, very textually romantic way"". He later said that he had fought hard for Catra and Adora during the show's development.

Thermal energy,"The term ""thermal energy"" is often used ambiguously in physics and engineering. It can denote several different physical concepts, including:

Internal energy: The energy contained within a body of matter or radiation, excluding the potential energy of the whole system.
Heat: Energy in transfer between a system and its surroundings by mechanisms other than thermodynamic work and transfer of matter.
The characteristic energy kBT associated with a single microscopic degree of freedom, where T denotes temperature and kB denotes the Boltzmann constant.
Mark Zemansky (1970) has argued that the term ""thermal energy"" is best avoided due to its ambiguity. He suggests using more precise terms such as ""internal energy"" and ""heat"" to avoid confusion. The term is, however, used in some textbooks.

Relation between heat and internal energy
In thermodynamics, heat is energy in transfer to or from a thermodynamic system by mechanisms other than thermodynamic work or transfer of matter, such as conduction, radiation, and friction. Heat refers to a quantity in transfer between systems, not to a property of any one system, or ""contained"" within it; on the other hand, internal energy and enthalpy are properties of a single system. Heat and work depend on the way in which an energy transfer occurs. In contrast, internal energy is a property of the state of a system and can thus be understood without knowing how the energy got there.

Macroscopic thermal energy
In addition to the microscopic kinetic energies of its molecules, the internal energy of a body includes chemical energy belonging to distinct molecules, and the global joint potential energy involved in the interactions between molecules and suchlike. Thermal energy may be viewed as contributing to internal energy or to enthalpy.

Chemical internal energy
The internal energy of a body can change in a process in which chemical potential energy is converted into  non-chemical energy. In such a process, the thermodynamic system can change its internal energy by doing work on its surroundings, or by gaining or losing energy as heat. It is not quite lucid to merely say that ""the converted chemical potential energy has simply become internal energy"". It is, however, sometimes convenient to say that ""the chemical potential energy has been converted into thermal energy"". This is expressed in ordinary traditional language by talking of 'heat of reaction'.

Potential energy of internal interactions
In a body of material, especially in condensed matter, such as a liquid or a solid, in which the constituent particles, such as molecules or ions, interact strongly with one another, the energies of such interactions contribute strongly to the internal energy of the body. Still, they are not immediately apparent in the kinetic energies of molecules, as manifest in temperature. Such energies of interaction may be thought of as contributions to the global internal microscopic potential energies of the body.

Microscopic thermal energy
In a statistical mechanical account of an ideal gas, in which the molecules move independently between instantaneous collisions, the internal energy is just the sum total of the gas's independent particles' kinetic energies, and it is this kinetic motion that is the source and the effect of the transfer of heat across a system's boundary. For a gas that does not have particle interactions except for instantaneous collisions, the term ""thermal energy"" is effectively synonymous with ""internal energy"".
In many statistical physics texts, ""thermal energy"" refers to 
  
    
      
        k
        T
      
    
    {\displaystyle kT}

    {\displaystyle k_{\text{B}}T}
  
.

Thermal current density
When there is no accompanying flow of matter, the term ""thermal energy"" is also applied to the energy carried by a heat flow.

Debouch,"In hydrology, a debouch (or debouche) is a place where runoff from a small, confined space discharges into a larger, broader body of water. The word is derived from the French verb déboucher (French: [debuʃe]), which means ""to unblock, to clear"". The term also has a military usage.

Geology
In fluvial geomorphology, a debouch is a place where runoff from a small, confined space emerges into a larger, broader space. Common examples are when a stream runs into a river or when a river runs into an ocean. Debouching can generate massive amounts of sediment transport. When a narrow stream travels down a mountain pass into a basin, an alluvial fan will form from the mass deposit of the sediment. The four largest rivers (the Amazon, the Ganges, the Yangtze and the Yellow) are responsible for 20% of the global discharge of sediment in to the oceans by debouches.

Geography
In fluvial geography, a debouch is a place where a body of water pours forth from a narrow opening. Some examples are: where a river or stream emerges from a narrow constraining landform, such as a defile, into open country or a wider space; a creek joins a river; or a stream flows into a lake.

Military
In military usage of debouch: as a noun, a fortification at the end of a defile is sometimes known as a debouch; and as a verb, soldiers emerging from a narrow space and spreading out are also said to ""debouch"".

Mountain river,"A mountain river is a river that runs usually in mountains, in narrow, deep valley with steep banks, rocky stream bed, and accumulated rock debris.
Mountain rivers are characterized by high slope and flow velocity, insignificant depth, frequent rapids and waterfalls, as well as dominated washed out processes. The gradient of a mountain river is calculated at 60–80 m/km in upper stream and 5–10 m/km in lower. More precisely it is greater than or equal to 0.002 m/m along most of its stream length. Speed of stream is measured at 1 to 4.5 m/s and higher. 
Mountain rivers have significant hydro energy producing potential and in arid conditions often used for irrigation.
They play an essential role in shaping the surrounding landscape through erosion and deposition, creating deep valleys, gorges, and waterfalls.
Features of a Mountain River:
1. Steep Gradient: The river descends rapidly from higher altitudes, often forming rapids and cascades.
2. Cold and Clear Water: The water is usually fresh, cool, and rich in oxygen, supporting diverse aquatic life.
3. Rocky Channels: These rivers often flow through rugged terrain with boulders and gravel in their beds.
4. Erosion Power: Due to their speed and volume, they erode rocks and transport sediments downstream.

Geography,"Geography (from Ancient Greek γεωγραφία geōgraphía; combining gê 'Earth' and gráphō 'write', literally 'Earth writing') is the study of the lands, features, inhabitants, and phenomena of Earth. Geography is an all-encompassing discipline that seeks an understanding of Earth and its human and natural complexities—not merely where objects are, but also how they have changed and come to be. While geography is specific to Earth, many concepts can be applied more broadly to other celestial bodies in the field of planetary science. Geography has been called ""a bridge between natural science and social science disciplines.""
Origins of many of the concepts in geography can be traced to Greek Eratosthenes of Cyrene, who may have coined the term ""geographia"" (c. 276 BC – c. 195/194 BC). The first recorded use of the word γεωγραφία was as the title of a book by Greek scholar Claudius Ptolemy (100 – 170 AD). This work created the so-called ""Ptolemaic tradition"" of geography, which included ""Ptolemaic cartographic theory."" However, the concepts of geography (such as cartography) date back to the earliest attempts to understand the world spatially, with the earliest example of an attempted world map dating to the 9th century BCE in ancient Babylon. The history of geography as a discipline spans cultures and millennia, being independently developed by multiple groups, and cross-pollinated by trade between these groups. The core concepts of geography consistent between all approaches are a focus on space, place, time, and scale. Today, geography is an extremely broad discipline with multiple approaches and modalities. There have been multiple attempts to organize the discipline, including the four traditions of geography, and into branches. Techniques employed can generally be broken down into quantitative and qualitative approaches, with many studies taking mixed-methods approaches. Common techniques include cartography, remote sensing, interviews, and surveying.

Fundamentals
Geography is a systematic study of the Earth (other celestial bodies are specified, such as ""geography of Mars"", or given another name, such as areography in the case of Mars, or selenography in the case of the Moon, or planetography for the general case), its features, and phenomena that take place on it. For something to fall into the domain of geography, it generally needs some sort of spatial component that can be placed on a map, such as coordinates, place names, or addresses. This has led to geography being associated with cartography and place names. Although many geographers are trained in toponymy and cartology, this is not their main preoccupation. Geographers study the Earth's spatial and temporal distribution of phenomena, processes, and features as well as the interaction of humans and their environment. Because space and place affect a variety of topics, such as economics, health, climate, plants, and animals, geography is highly interdisciplinary. The interdisciplinary nature of the geographical approach depends on an attentiveness to the relationship between physical and human phenomena and their spatial patterns.
While narrowing down geography to a few key concepts is extremely challenging, and subject to tremendous debate within the discipline, several sources have approached the topic. The 1st edition of the book ""Key Concepts in Geography"" broke down this into chapters focusing on ""Space,"" ""Place,"" ""Time,"" ""Scale,"" and ""Landscape."" The 2nd edition of the book expanded on these key concepts by adding ""Environmental systems,"" ""Social Systems,"" ""Nature,"" ""Globalization,"" ""Development,"" and ""Risk,"" demonstrating how challenging narrowing the field can be. Another approach used extensively in teaching geography are the Five themes of geography established by ""Guidelines for Geographic Education: Elementary and Secondary Schools,"" published jointly by the National Council for Geographic Education and the Association of American Geographers in 1984. These themes are Location, place, relationships within places (often summarized as Human-Environment Interaction), movement, and regions. The five themes of geography have shaped how American education approaches the topic in the years since.

Space
Just as all phenomena exist in time and thus have a history, they also exist in space and have a geography.
For something to exist in the realm of geography, it must be able to be described spatially. Thus, space is the most fundamental concept at the foundation of geography. The concept is so basic, that geographers often have difficulty defining exactly what it is. Absolute space is the exact site, or spatial coordinates, of objects, persons, places, or phenomena under investigation. We exist in space. Absolute space leads to the view of the world as a photograph, with everything frozen in place when the coordinates were recorded. Today, geographers are trained to recognize the world as a dynamic space where all processes interact and take plac",Geography,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography,1,geography ancient greek γεωγραφία geōgraphía combining gê earth gráphō write literally earth writing study land feature inhabitant phenomenon earth geography allencompassing discipline seek understanding earth human natural complexities—not merely object also changed come geography specific earth many concept applied broadly celestial body field planetary science geography called bridge natural science social science discipline origin many concept geography traced greek eratosthenes cyrene may coined term geographia c bc – c bc first recorded use word γεωγραφία title book greek scholar claudius ptolemy – ad work created socalled ptolemaic tradition geography included ptolemaic cartographic theory however concept geography cartography date back earliest attempt understand world spatially earliest example attempted world map dating th century bce ancient babylon history geography discipline span culture millennium independently developed multiple group crosspollinated trade group core concept geography consistent approach focus space place time scale today geography extremely broad discipline multiple approach modality multiple attempt organize discipline including four tradition geography branch technique employed generally broken quantitative qualitative approach many study taking mixedmethods approach common technique include cartography remote sensing interview surveying fundamental geography systematic study earth celestial body specified geography mar given another name areography case mar selenography case moon planetography general case feature phenomenon take place something fall domain geography generally need sort spatial component placed map coordinate place name address led geography associated cartography place name although many geographer trained toponymy cartology main preoccupation geographer study earth spatial temporal distribution phenomenon process feature well interaction human environment space place affect variety topic economics health climate plant animal geography highly interdisciplinary interdisciplinary nature geographical approach depends attentiveness relationship physical human phenomenon spatial pattern narrowing geography key concept extremely challenging subject tremendous debate within discipline several source approached topic st edition book key concept geography broke chapter focusing space place time scale landscape nd edition book expanded key concept adding environmental system social system nature globalization development risk demonstrating challenging narrowing field another approach used extensively teaching geography five theme geography established guideline geographic education elementary secondary school published jointly national council geographic education association american geographer theme location place relationship within place often summarized humanenvironment interaction movement region five theme geography shaped american education approach topic year since space phenomenon exist time thus history also exist space geography something exist realm geography must able described spatially thus space fundamental concept foundation geography concept basic geographer often difficulty defining exactly absolute space exact site spatial coordinate object person place phenomenon investigation exist space absolute space lead view world photograph everything frozen place coordinate recorded today geographer trained recognize world dynamic space process interact take plac
Australia (continent),"The continent of Australia, sometimes known in technical contexts as Sahul (), Australia-New Guinea, Australinea, or Meganesia to distinguish it from the country of Australia, is located within the Southern and Eastern hemispheres, near the Maritime Southeast Asia. The continent includes mainland Australia, Tasmania, the island of New Guinea (Papua New Guinea and Western New Guinea), the Aru Islands, the Ashmore and Cartier Islands, most of the Coral Sea Islands, and some other nearby islands. Situated in the geographical region of Oceania, more specifically in the subregion of Australasia, Australia is the smallest of the seven traditional continents.
The continent includes a continental shelf overlain by shallow seas which divide it into several landmasses—the Arafura Sea and Torres Strait between mainland Australia and New Guinea, and Bass Strait between mainland Australia and Tasmania. When sea levels were lower during the Pleistocene ice age, including the Last Glacial Maximum about 18,000 BC, they were connected by dry land into the combined landmass of Sahul. The name ""Sahul"" derives from the Sahul Shelf, which is a part of the continental shelf of the Australian continent. During the past 18,000 to 10,000 years, rising sea levels overflowed the lowlands and separated the continent into today's low-lying arid to semi-arid mainland and the two mountainous islands of New Guinea and Tasmania. With a total land area of 8.56 million square kilometres (3,310,000 sq mi), the Australian continent is the smallest, lowest, flattest, and second-driest continent (after Antarctica) on Earth. As the country of Australia is mostly on a single landmass, and comprises most of the continent, it is sometimes informally referred to as an island continent, surrounded by oceans.
Papua New Guinea, a country within the continent, is one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse countries in the world. It is also one of the most rural, as only 18 percent of its people live in urban centres. West Papua, a region in Indonesia, is home to an estimated 44 uncontacted tribal groups. Australia, the largest landmass in the continent, is highly urbanised, and has the world's 14th-largest economy with the second-highest human development index globally. Australia also has the world's 9th largest immigrant population.

Terminology
The continent of Australia is sometimes known by the names Sahul, Australinea, or Meganesia to differentiate it from the country of Australia, and consists of the landmasses which sit on Australia's continental plate. This includes mainland Australia, Tasmania, and the island of New Guinea, which comprises Papua New Guinea and Western New Guinea (Papua and West Papua, provinces of Indonesia). The name ""Sahul"" takes its name from the Sahul Shelf, which is part of the continental shelf of the Australian continent. The term Oceania, originally a ""great division"" of the world in the 1810s, was replaced in English language countries by the concept of Australia as one of the world's continents in the 1950s.
Prior to the 1950s, before the popularization of the theory of plate tectonics, Antarctica, Australia and Greenland were sometimes described as island continents, but none were usually taught as one of the world's continents in English-speaking countries. Scottish cartographer John Bartholomew wrote in 1873 that, ""the New World consists of North America, and the peninsula of South America attached to it. These divisions [are] generally themselves spoken as continents, and to them has been added another, embracing the large island of Australia and numerous others in the [Pacific] Ocean, under the name of Oceania. There are thus six great divisions of the earth — Europe, Asia, Africa, North America, South America and Oceania.""
The American author Samuel Griswold Goodrich wrote in his 1854 book History of All Nations that, ""geographers have agreed to consider the island world of the Pacific Ocean as a third continent, under the name Oceania."" In this book the other two continents were categorized as being the New World (consisting of North America and South America) and the Old World (consisting of Africa, Asia and Europe). In his 1879 book Australasia, British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace commented that, ""Oceania is the word often used by continental geographers to describe the great world of islands we are now entering upon"" and that ""Australia forms its central and most important feature."" He did not explicitly label Oceania a continent in the book, but did note that it was one of the six major divisions of the world. He considered it to encompass the insular Pacific area between Asia and the Americas, and claimed it extended up to the Aleutian Islands, which are among the northernmost islands in the Pacific Ocean. However, definitions of Oceania varied during the 19th century. In the 19th century, many geographers divided up Oceania into mostly racially-based subdivisions; Australasia, Malaysia (en",Continents,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_(continent),1,continent australia sometimes known technical context sahul australianew guinea australinea meganesia distinguish country australia located within southern eastern hemisphere near maritime southeast asia continent includes mainland australia tasmania island new guinea papua new guinea western new guinea aru island ashmore cartier island coral sea island nearby island situated geographical region oceania specifically subregion australasia australia smallest seven traditional continent continent includes continental shelf overlain shallow sea divide several landmasses—the arafura sea torres strait mainland australia new guinea bass strait mainland australia tasmania sea level lower pleistocene ice age including last glacial maximum bc connected dry land combined landmass sahul name sahul derives sahul shelf part continental shelf australian continent past year rising sea level overflowed lowland separated continent today lowlying arid semiarid mainland two mountainous island new guinea tasmania total land area million square kilometre sq mi australian continent smallest lowest flattest seconddriest continent antarctica earth country australia mostly single landmass comprises continent sometimes informally referred island continent surrounded ocean papua new guinea country within continent one culturally linguistically diverse country world also one rural percent people live urban centre west papua region indonesia home estimated uncontacted tribal group australia largest landmass continent highly urbanised world thlargest economy secondhighest human development index globally australia also world th largest immigrant population terminology continent australia sometimes known name sahul australinea meganesia differentiate country australia consists landmass sit australia continental plate includes mainland australia tasmania island new guinea comprises papua new guinea western new guinea papua west papua province indonesia name sahul take name sahul shelf part continental shelf australian continent term oceania originally great division world replaced english language country concept australia one world continent prior popularization theory plate tectonics antarctica australia greenland sometimes described island continent none usually taught one world continent englishspeaking country scottish cartographer john bartholomew wrote new world consists north america peninsula south america attached division generally spoken continent added another embracing large island australia numerous others pacific ocean name oceania thus six great division earth — europe asia africa north america south america oceania american author samuel griswold goodrich wrote book history nation geographer agreed consider island world pacific ocean third continent name oceania book two continent categorized new world consisting north america south america old world consisting africa asia europe book australasia british naturalist alfred russel wallace commented oceania word often used continental geographer describe great world island entering upon australia form central important feature explicitly label oceania continent book note one six major division world considered encompass insular pacific area asia america claimed extended aleutian island among northernmost island pacific ocean however definition oceania varied th century th century many geographer divided oceania mostly raciallybased subdivision australasia malaysia en
Dakar Rally,"The Dakar Rally (French: Le Rallye Dakar) or simply ""The Dakar"" (Le Dakar), formerly known as the Paris–Dakar Rally (Le Rallye Paris-Dakar), is an annual rally raid organised by the Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO). It is an off-road endurance event traversing terrain much tougher than conventional  rallying, and the vehicles used are typically true off-road vehicles and motorcycles, rather than modified on-road vehicles. Most of the competitive special sections are off-road, crossing dunes, mud, camel grass, rocks, and erg. Stages vary from short distances up to 800–900 kilometres (500–560 mi) per day. The rough terrain, driver fatigue, and lack of skill usually results in accidents and serious injuries.
The event began in 1978 as a rally from Paris, France, to Dakar, Senegal. Between 1992 and 2007 some editions did not start in Paris or did not arrive in Dakar, but the rally kept its name. Security threats in Mauritania led to the cancellation of the 2008 rally, and from 2009 to 2019 the rally was held in South America. Since 2020, the rally has been held in Saudi Arabia. The rally is open to amateurs and professionals, with professionals typically making up about eighty percent of participants.

History
Predecessors
The Mediterranean Rally (also known as Algiers-Cape Town Rally) was a trans-Africa rally run in 5 editions between 1951 and 1961. It evolved from the original mixed road and off-road rally to a fully off-road endurance event, during the pioneer years of trans-Africa rallies.

Crossing the Sahara
The race originated in December 1977, a year after Thierry Sabine got lost in the Ténéré desert whilst competing in the 1975 ""Rallye Côte-Côte"" between Abidjan and Nice and decided that the desert would be a good location for a regular rally, on the lines of the 1974 London–Sahara–Munich World Cup Rally, the first automobile race to cross the Sahara Desert twice.
In 1971, ex-Cream drummer Ginger Baker used the unproven Range Rover to drive from Algeria to Lagos, Nigeria to set up a recording studio and jam with Fela Kuti. Predating the Paris-Dakar Rally the subsequent documentary is replete with such terrain, and documents the vehicle's endurance.

Early growth
182 vehicles took the start of the inaugural rally in Paris, with 74 surviving the 10,000-kilometre (6,200 mi) trip to the Senegalese capital of Dakar. Cyril Neveu was the event's first winner, riding a Yamaha motorcycle. The event rapidly grew in popularity, with 216 vehicles taking the start in 1980 and 291 in 1981. The privateer spirit of early racers tackling the event with limited resources encouraged such entrants as Thierry de Montcorgé in a Rolls-Royce and Formula 1 driver Jacky Ickx with actor Claude Brasseur in a Citroën CX, in the 1981 race won by two-time winner Hubert Auriol.
In 1982, there were 382 racers, more than double the number that took the start in 1979. Neveu won the event for a third time, this time riding a Honda motorcycle, while victory in the car class went to the Marreau brothers, driving a privately entered Renault 20. Auriol captured his second bikes class victory in 1983, the first year that Japanese manufacturer Mitsubishi competed in the rally, beginning an association that would last until 2009.
At the behest of 1983 car class winner Jacky Ickx, Porsche entered the Dakar in 1984, with the total number of entries now at 427. The German marque won the event at their first attempt courtesy of René Metge, who had previously won in the car category in 1981, whilst Ickx finished sixth. Gaston Rahier meanwhile continued BMW's success in the motorcycle category with back-to-back wins in 1984 and 1985, the year of Mitsubishi's first victory of 12 in the car category, Patrick Zaniroli taking the spoils. The 1986 event, won by Metge and Neveu, was marred by the death of event founder Sabine in a helicopter crash, his father Gilbert taking over organisation of the rally.

Peugeot and Citroën domination
The 1987 rally marked the start of an era of increased official factory participation in the car category, as French manufacturer Peugeot arrived and won the event with former World Rally champion Ari Vatanen. The 1987 event was also notable for a ferocious head-to-head duel between Neveu and Auriol in the motorcycle category, the former taking his fifth victory after Auriol was forced to drop out of the rally after breaking both ankles in a fall. The 1988 event reached its zenith in terms of entry numbers, with 603 starters. Vatanen's title defence was derailed when his Peugeot was stolen from the service area at Bamako. Though it was later found, Vatanen was subsequently disqualified from the event, victory instead going to compatriot and teammate Juha Kankkunen.
Peugeot and Vatanen returned to winning ways in 1989 and 1990, the latter marking Peugeot's final year of rally competition before switching to the World Sportscar Championship. Sister brand Citroën took Peugeot's place, Vatanen taking a third consecutive victory ",Deserts,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakar_Rally,1,dakar rally french le rallye dakar simply dakar le dakar formerly known paris–dakar rally le rallye parisdakar annual rally raid organised amaury sport organisation aso offroad endurance event traversing terrain much tougher conventional rallying vehicle used typically true offroad vehicle motorcycle rather modified onroad vehicle competitive special section offroad crossing dune mud camel grass rock erg stage vary short distance – kilometre – mi per day rough terrain driver fatigue lack skill usually result accident serious injury event began rally paris france dakar senegal edition start paris arrive dakar rally kept name security threat mauritania led cancellation rally rally held south america since rally held saudi arabia rally open amateur professional professional typically making eighty percent participant history predecessor mediterranean rally also known algierscape town rally transafrica rally run edition evolved original mixed road offroad rally fully offroad endurance event pioneer year transafrica rally crossing sahara race originated december year thierry sabine got lost ténéré desert whilst competing rallye côtecôte abidjan nice decided desert would good location regular rally line london–sahara–munich world cup rally first automobile race cross sahara desert twice excream drummer ginger baker used unproven range rover drive algeria lagos nigeria set recording studio jam fela kuti predating parisdakar rally subsequent documentary replete terrain document vehicle endurance early growth vehicle took start inaugural rally paris surviving kilometre mi trip senegalese capital dakar cyril neveu event first winner riding yamaha motorcycle event rapidly grew popularity vehicle taking start privateer spirit early racer tackling event limited resource encouraged entrant thierry de montcorgé rollsroyce formula driver jacky ickx actor claude brasseur citroën cx race twotime winner hubert auriol racer double number took start neveu event third time time riding honda motorcycle victory car class went marreau brother driving privately entered renault auriol captured second bike class victory first year japanese manufacturer mitsubishi competed rally beginning association would last behest car class winner jacky ickx porsche entered dakar total number entry german marque event first attempt courtesy rené metge previously car category whilst ickx finished sixth gaston rahier meanwhile continued bmws success motorcycle category backtoback win year mitsubishis first victory car category patrick zaniroli taking spoil event metge neveu marred death event founder sabine helicopter crash father gilbert taking organisation rally peugeot citroën domination rally marked start era increased official factory participation car category french manufacturer peugeot arrived event former world rally champion ari vatanen event also notable ferocious headtohead duel neveu auriol motorcycle category former taking fifth victory auriol forced drop rally breaking ankle fall event reached zenith term entry number starter vatanens title defence derailed peugeot stolen service area bamako though later found vatanen subsequently disqualified event victory instead going compatriot teammate juha kankkunen peugeot vatanen returned winning way latter marking peugeots final year rally competition switching world sportscar championship sister brand citroën took peugeots place vatanen taking third consecutive victory
Surface stress,"Surface stress was first defined by Josiah Willard Gibbs (1839–1903) as the amount of the reversible work per unit area needed to elastically stretch a pre-existing surface. Depending upon the convention used, the area is either the original, unstretched one which represents a constant number of atoms, or sometimes is the final area; these are atomistic versus continuum definitions. Some care is needed to ensure that the definition used is also consistent with the elastic strain energy, and misinterpretations and disagreements have occurred in the literature.
A similar term called ""surface free energy"", the excess free energy per unit area needed to create a new surface, is sometimes confused with ""surface stress"". Although surface stress and surface free energy of liquid–gas or liquid–liquid interface are the same, they are very different in solid–gas or solid–solid interface. Both terms represent an energy per unit area, equivalent to a  force per unit length, so are sometimes referred to as ""surface tension"", which contributes further to the confusion in the literature.

Thermodynamics of surface stress
The continuum definition of surface free energy is the amount of reversible work 
  
    
      
        d
        w
      
    
    {\displaystyle dw}

        γ
        d
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle dw=\gamma dA}
  

In this definition the number of atoms at the surface is proportional to the area. Gibbs was the first to define another surface quantity, different from the surface free energy 
  
    
      
        γ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \gamma }
  
, that is associated with the reversible work per unit area needed to elastically stretch a pre-existing surface. In a continuum approach one can define a surface stress tensor

called the Shuttleworth equation. 
An alternative approach is an atomistic one, which defines all quantities in terms of the number of atoms, not continuum measures such as areas. This is related to the ideal of using Gibb's equimolar quantities rather than continuum numbers such as area, that is keeping the number of surface atoms constant. In this case the surface stress is defined as the derivative of the surface energy with strain, that is (deliberately using a different symbol)

Creative Cities,"Creative Cities is an international project started in 2007 and managed by the British Council. It shares experiences across Europe on the ways creativity, entrepreneurship and innovation can help improving people's lives – making cities better places to live, work and play.

About
Background
With over 70% of Europe's population now living in urban areas, cities have a vital role in delivering economic and social well-being for Europe. A new generation of urban influencers and innovators is emerging which recognises that culture and creativity is central to addressing the challenges cities face. Creative Cities supports this new generation, providing opportunities to develop and share ideas which make Europe's cities better places to live, work and play.

British Council proposal
The British Council developed the Creative Cities project in 2007, in partnership with a range of cities and organisations active in developing innovative approaches to city policy. Individuals taking part in project events develop new skills and build new contacts across Europe. Cities which join the project network have an opportunity to establish competitive advantage for themselves and attract creative talent, and in so doing set the foundations for future economic growth. The Creative Cities project is running in the UK, Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia, Ukraine, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Russia.

Short description
Creative Cities emerge from the search for new solutions to post-industrial urban problems, including high crime rate, degradation of urban infrastructures, and social separation.
Creative Cities explores new ways to improve quality of life in cities by involving young professionals from various backgrounds. During the course of the project these young people will acquire knowledge, networks, skills and tools to give them more influence on decisions made about the urban environment they live in. This will enable them to make a difference on a range of issues such as: public spaces, arts and social activities, and cultural policy.
The three core project strands are: Future City Game, Urban Ideas Bakery and Urban Forum. In addition to the three strands, the project provides platforms to enable young social innovators in Europe to keep in touch with the project and each other: an interactive website, a Facebook group, Twitter and an e-mail newsletter.
In recent years, the concept of the creative city was increasingly used as part of national branding campaigns in Europe (e.g. Creative Britain) and adopted by cities and organizations. Amid this development, there emerge the so-called creativity indices, which outlined and measured various interpretations of creativity in cities and countries. These result in an extremely diverse range of activities and initiatives that contribute to the realization of the creative city model, which is aligned with the goal of the Creative Cities to discover social innovation, creativity, and new thinking to make cities better places to live in.

Methods and tools
Future City Game
Generates new ideas on how to improve the quality of life either in a specific area within a city, the city as a whole, or in response to the common challenges facing cities around the world.
A one-day or two-day event involving city inhabitants from diverse backgrounds, representing different disciplines and led by a trained games-master.
Uses a team based process, with a unique and innovative methodology developed by the British Council in partnership with CLES – Centre for Local Economic Strategies and Urbis – Manchester's Centre of Urban Life.

Urban Ideas Bakery
Builds skills and shares experience on how cities 'bake ideas' – that is turn them into practical solutions.
A problem-solving and planning process that puts people at the centre of social innovation; it includes a two-day international event engaging social innovators and experts from across Europe and local community representatives.

Urban Forum
The urban forum consists of international conferences and workshops providing a forum for ongoing debate on the role that creativity, entrepreneurship and innovation play in urban development. In a report to the UK Parliament, it was said that this forum has also been engaging young politicians to explore issues emphasized in the Creative Cities initiative alongside issues that revolve around people, politics, and youth action. The urban forum also involves creative events which demonstrate new ways cities can inspire creativity in the community.

Endangered river,"An endangered river is one which has the potential to partly or fully dry up, or one that is thought to have ecological issues now or in the near future. Some such issues are natural while others are the direct result of human development. Organisations including the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) have published lists of rivers at risk. The WWF's 2007 list featured the Danube, the Nile, and the Rio Grande amongst others, stating that these ""once great rivers"" are in danger and ""can no longer be assured of reaching the sea unhindered"". The US National Park Service reported in 2015 that part of the Rio Grande ""often lies dry"". Dangers may be the result of the natural change of conditions in the local environment but many are due to human development projects such as dams and irrigation. Humans have also caused significant water pollution which endangers life which relies upon the water source.

Importance
According to the World Resources Institute (WRI) river basins are ""indispensable resources for billions of people, companies, farms, and ecosystems"" but many suffer from ""water stress"". It states that numerous major rivers around the world have become depleted to the point that they can fail to reach their destinations. Water scarcity is a danger to all the life that depends on the source.

Dangers to rivers
Rivers face many dangers, both natural and manmade. Climate change can have a significant impact on rivers, both positive and negative. This could be seen itself as an indirect result of human developments. An area which has a reduction in rainfall or an increase in temperature can make a river fully or partially dry out. This often means that the water can no longer reach its mouth.
The flora and fauna of an area can face change and can have a substantial impact on landscape and local ecology. Invasive species can move into an area or be introduced by humans. One particular example of the latter is the case of beavers being introduced into Tierra del Fuego in 1946. While only 20 animals were transplanted into the area they quickly reproduced with no natural predator to curb numbers. Their effect on the area, through the damaging gnawing of trees and the building of their dams, has been significant enough that humans continue an attempt to undo their mistake with a program of beaver eradication. The ponds created by the beavers, which now number in the tens of thousands, have greatly contributed to the amount of organic matter retained by the rivers which then causes more problems downstream.

Specific human factors
Human interference in the form of river engineering can redirect the flow of the water using dams or channelisation. The increasing demand from irrigated agriculture, continued industrialisation, and residential use heavily impacts upon the health of river systems. This means that many areas face high levels of ""baseline water stress"". Rivers can be cut off from their floodplains and their normal route can be changed or disrupted significantly. If improperly managed this can have a devastating effect on the surrounding area and endanger the plants and animals that depend on them, including humans. Water pollution is another artificial danger which can be a serious threat to wildlife and human health. The Colorado River runs from the Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado through four other states, parts of Mexico, and then on to the Gulf of California. Due to the human demands for water very little reaches Mexico and what does is often polluted. The Teesta River faces similar issues. The river flows through India and into Bangladesh, but India's water demands led to the part of the river in Bangladesh to dry up in 2018. If the situation continues it could be catastrophic for the local ecosystem.
The Rio Grande Project was an irrigation, hydroelectricity, flood control, and interbasin water transfer project serving the upper Rio Grande basin in the southwestern United States. It was completed in 1952 and has had a significant impact on the surrounding area. In the past, the river was wide, deep and fast-flowing in its section through Texas, where it forms a large part of the Mexico – United States border. Illegal immigrants once had to swim across the river at the border, but with the river so low immigrants need only wade across for most of the year. After leaving El Paso the Rio Grande often runs dry because so much water has been diverted away for human use. Other than extensive diversions, exotic introduced, fast-growing and water-consuming plants, such as water hyacinth and hydrilla, are also leading to reduced flows. The United States government has recently attempted to slow or stop the progress of these weeds by introducing insects and fish that feed on the invasive plants.

Charged aerosol detector,"The charged aerosol detector (CAD) is a detector used in conjunction with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and ultra high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) to measure the amount of chemicals in a sample by creating charged aerosol particles which are detected using an electrometer. It is commonly used for the analysis of compounds that cannot be detected using traditional UV/Vis approaches due to their lack of a chromophore. The CAD can measure all non-volatile and many semi-volatile analytes including, but not limited to, antibiotics, excipients, ions, lipids, natural products, biofuels, sugars and surfactants. The CAD, like other aerosol detectors (e.g., evaporative light scattering detectors (ELSD) and condensation nucleation light scattering detectors (CNLSD)), falls under the category of destructive general-purpose detectors (see Chromatography detectors).

History
The predecessor to the CAD, termed an evaporative electrical detector, was first described by Kaufman in 2002 at TSI Inc in US patent 6,568,245 and was based on the coupling of liquid chromatographic approaches to TSI's electrical aerosol measurement (EAM) technology.  At around the same time Dixon and Peterson at California State University were investigating the coupling of liquid chromatography to an earlier version of TSI's EAM technology, which they called an aerosol charge detector. Subsequent collaboration between TSI and ESA Biosciences Inc. (now part of Thermo Fisher Scientific), led to the first commercial instrument, the Corona CAD, which received both the Pittsburgh Conference Silver Pittcon Editor's Award (2005) and R&D 100 award (2005). Continued research and engineering improvements in product design resulted in CADs with ever increasing capabilities. The newest iterations of the CAD are the Thermo Scientific Corona Veo Charged Aerosol Detector, Corona Veo RS Charged Aerosol Detector and Thermo Scientific Vanquish Charged Aerosol Detectors.

Principles of operation
The general detection scheme  involves:

Pneumatic nebulization of mobile phase from the analytical column forming an aerosol.
Aerosol conditioning to remove large droplets.
Evaporation of solvent from the droplets to form dried particles.
Particle charging using an ion jet formed via corona discharge.
Particle selection – an ion trap is used to excess ions and high mobility charged particles.
Measurement of the aggregate charge of aerosol particles using a filter/electrometer.
The CAD like other aerosol detectors, can only be used with volatile mobile phases. For an analyte to be detected it must be less volatile than the mobile phase.
More detailed information on how CAD works can be found on the Charged Aerosol Detection for Liquid Chromatography Resource Center.

Performance and comparison to other aerosol detectors
The CAD and evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD) are mass-flow sensitive detectors (response is proportional to mass of analyte reaching the detector per unit time) as opposed to concentration sensitive (response is proportional to analyte concentration within the eluent at a particular time) detectors such as UV detectors.
Both the CAD and ELSD exhibit non-linear responses for most sample types; however, over small ranges (e.g. 1–100 ng) CAD response is reasonably linear. The shape of the response curves are different between the two detectors.
Both detectors require the use of fully volatile mobile phases and non-volatile samples. CAD response is dependent on organic content of the mobile phase, response is higher with organic-rich mobile phases than aqueous ones.
CAD response is quite uniform for non-volatile analytes with detection limit 1–3 ng; however, the response for ionised basic analytes can be larger than for neutral analytes.
When properly individually optimized, both the CAD and ELSD show similar responses.
Failure to regularly clean and optimize the mobile phase and gas flow properties of the detector leads to intra- and inter-day precision/ reproducibility errors.

Chaos engineering,"Chaos engineering is the discipline of experimenting on a system in order to build confidence in the system's capability to withstand turbulent conditions in production.

Concept
In software development, the ability of a given software to tolerate failures while still ensuring adequate quality of service—often termed resilience—is typically specified as a requirement. However, development teams may fail to meet this requirement due to factors such as short deadlines or lack of domain knowledge. Chaos engineering encompasses techniques aimed at meeting resilience requirements.
Chaos engineering can be used to achieve resilience against infrastructure failures, network failures, and application failures.

Operational readiness using chaos engineering
Calculating how much confidence we have in the interconnected complex systems that are put into production environments requires operational readiness metrics. Operational readiness can be evaluated using chaos engineering simulations. Solutions for increasing the resilience and operational readiness of a platform include strengthening the backup, restore, network file transfer, failover capabilities and overall security of the environment.
An evaluation to induce chaos in a Kubernetes environment terminated random pods receiving data from edge devices in data centers while processing analytics on a big data network. The pods' recovery time was a resiliency metric that estimated the response time.

History
1983 – Apple
While MacWrite and MacPaint were being developed for the first Apple Macintosh computer, Steve Capps created ""Monkey"", a desk accessory which randomly generated user interface events at high speed, simulating a monkey frantically banging the keyboard and moving and clicking the mouse. It was promptly put to use for debugging by generating errors for programmers to fix, because automated testing was not possible; the first Macintosh had too little free memory space for anything more sophisticated.
1992 – Prologue
While ABAL2 and SING were being developed for the first graphical versions of the PROLOGUE operating system, Iain James Marshall created ""La Matraque"", a desk accessory which randomly generated random sequences of both legal and invalid graphical interface events, at high speed, thus testing the critical edge behaviour of the underlying graphics libraries. This program would be launched prior to production delivery, for days on end, thus ensuring the required degree of total resilience. This tool was subsequently extended to include the Database and other File Access instructions of the ABAL language to check and ensure their subsequent resiliance. A variation, of this tool, is currently employed for the qualification of the modern day version known as OPENABAL.
2003 – Amazon
While working to improve website reliability at Amazon, Jesse Robbins created ""Game day"", an initiative that increases reliability by purposefully creating major failures on a regular basis. Robbins has said it was inspired by firefighter training and research in other fields lessons in complex systems, reliability engineering.
2006 – Google
While at Google, Kripa Krishnan created a similar program to Amazon's Game day (see above) called ""DiRT"".
Jason Cahoon, a Site Reliability Engineer  at Google, contributed a chapter on Google DiRT  in the ""Chaos Engineering"" book  and described the system at the GOTOpia 2021 conference.
2011 – Netflix
While overseeing Netflix's migration to the cloud in 2011 Nora Jones, Casey Rosenthal, and Greg Orzell  expanded the discipline while working together at Netflix by setting up a tool that would cause breakdowns in their production environment, the environment used by Netflix customers. The intent was to move from a development model that assumed  no breakdowns to a model where breakdowns were considered to be inevitable, driving developers to consider built-in resilience to be an obligation rather than an option:

""At Netflix, our culture of freedom and responsibility led us not to force engineers to design their code in a specific way. Instead, we discovered that we could align our teams around the notion of infrastructure resilience by isolating the problems created by server neutralization and pushing them to the extreme. We have created Chaos Monkey, a program that randomly chooses a server and disables it during its usual hours of activity. Some will find that crazy, but we could not depend on the random occurrence of an event to test our behavior in the face of the very consequences of this event. Knowing that this would happen frequently has created a strong alignment among engineers to build redundancy and process automation to survive such incidents, without impacting the millions of Netflix users. Chaos Monkey is one of our most effective tools to improve the quality of our services.""
By regularly ""killing"" random instances of a software service, it was possible to test a redundant architecture to verify that a server failur",Netflix,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_engineering,0,chaos engineering discipline experimenting system order build confidence system capability withstand turbulent condition production concept software development ability given software tolerate failure still ensuring adequate quality service—often termed resilience—is typically specified requirement however development team may fail meet requirement due factor short deadline lack domain knowledge chaos engineering encompasses technique aimed meeting resilience requirement chaos engineering used achieve resilience infrastructure failure network failure application failure operational readiness using chaos engineering calculating much confidence interconnected complex system put production environment requires operational readiness metric operational readiness evaluated using chaos engineering simulation solution increasing resilience operational readiness platform include strengthening backup restore network file transfer failover capability overall security environment evaluation induce chaos kubernetes environment terminated random pod receiving data edge device data center processing analytics big data network pod recovery time resiliency metric estimated response time history – apple macwrite macpaint developed first apple macintosh computer steve capps created monkey desk accessory randomly generated user interface event high speed simulating monkey frantically banging keyboard moving clicking mouse promptly put use debugging generating error programmer fix automated testing possible first macintosh little free memory space anything sophisticated – prologue abal sing developed first graphical version prologue operating system iain james marshall created la matraque desk accessory randomly generated random sequence legal invalid graphical interface event high speed thus testing critical edge behaviour underlying graphic library program would launched prior production delivery day end thus ensuring required degree total resilience tool subsequently extended include database file access instruction abal language check ensure subsequent resiliance variation tool currently employed qualification modern day version known openabal – amazon working improve website reliability amazon jesse robbins created game day initiative increase reliability purposefully creating major failure regular basis robbins said inspired firefighter training research field lesson complex system reliability engineering – google google kripa krishnan created similar program amazon game day see called dirt jason cahoon site reliability engineer google contributed chapter google dirt chaos engineering book described system gotopia conference – netflix overseeing netflixs migration cloud nora jones casey rosenthal greg orzell expanded discipline working together netflix setting tool would cause breakdown production environment environment used netflix customer intent move development model assumed breakdown model breakdown considered inevitable driving developer consider builtin resilience obligation rather option netflix culture freedom responsibility led u force engineer design code specific way instead discovered could align team around notion infrastructure resilience isolating problem created server neutralization pushing extreme created chaos monkey program randomly chooses server disables usual hour activity find crazy could depend random occurrence event test behavior face consequence event knowing would happen frequently created strong alignment among engineer build redundancy process automation survive incident without impacting million netflix user chaos monkey one effective tool improve quality service regularly killing random instance software service possible test redundant architecture verify server failur
Bank (geography),"In geography, a bank is the land alongside a body of water. 
Different structures are referred to as banks in different fields of geography.
In limnology (the study of inland waters), a stream bank or river bank is the terrain alongside the bed of a river, creek, or stream. The bank consists of the sides of the channel, between which the flow is confined. Stream banks are of particular interest in fluvial geography, which studies the processes associated with rivers and streams and the deposits and landforms created by them. Bankfull discharge is a discharge  great enough to fill the channel and overtop the banks.

The descriptive terms left bank and right bank refer to the perspective of an observer looking downstream; a well-known example of this being the southern left bank and the northern right bank of the river Seine defining parts of Paris. The shoreline of ponds, swamps, estuaries, reservoirs, or lakes are also of interest in limnology and are sometimes referred to as banks. The grade of all these banks or shorelines can vary from vertical to a shallow slope.
In freshwater ecology, banks are of interest as the location of riparian habitats. Riparian zones occur along upland and lowland river and stream beds. The ecology around and depending on a marsh, swamp, slough, or estuary, sometimes called a bank, is likewise studied in freshwater ecology.
Banks are also of interest in navigation, where the term can refer either to a barrier island or a submerged plateau, such as an ocean bank. A barrier island is a long narrow island composed of sand and forming a barrier between an island lagoon or sound and the ocean. A submerged plateau is a relatively flat topped elevation of the sea floor at shallow depth — generally less than 200 metres (660 ft) — typically on the continental shelf or near an island.

Kirsten Abrahamson,"Kirsten Lillian Abrahamson is a Canadian ceramic artist and educator known for ceramics and mixed-media sculptures.
Born: June 16, 1960, Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.
Nationality: Canadian
Education:

Bachelor of Fine Arts (ceramics), University of Calgary, 1987
Master of Fine Arts (sculpture), University of Calgary, 1990
Diplomas in ceramics and glassblowing, Alberta College of Art and Design
Occupation: Artist, educator
Known For: Ceramic sculptures, mixed-media artworks
Children: 2

Early life and education
Kirsten Abrahamson was born in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1960. She moved to Canada with her family in early high school and subsequently became a Canadian citizen. Abrahamson moved to Calgary, Alberta, to study at the Alberta College of Art and Design, where she earned diplomas in ceramics and glassblowing.
In 1984 and 1985, Kirsten attended the summer sessions in ceramics at The Banff School of Fine Arts, Banff, Alberta. She also attended the University of Calgary from which she earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts (ceramics) in 1987 and Master of Fine Arts (sculpture) in 1990. Abrahamson was an artist in residence at the Alberta College of Art and Design, and later at the Banff Centre.
Her career evolved as an artist and as an instructor at post-secondary institutions.

Career and artistic practice
Abrahamson is a prominent Canadian artist, known for her figurative ceramic and mixed-media sculptures. Her work is described as autobiographical and journalistic, reflecting influences from history, symbols, cultural customs, and traditions. She often incorporates recycled materials into her practice, emphasizing environmental sustainability.
Throughout her career, Abrahamson has worked across multiple mediums, including glassblowing, pottery, and sculpture. Her practice explores themes of identity, personal experience, and the intersection of culture and history. Her sculptures often evoke a sense of multicultural identity.
Her involvement in the Redwork project highlights her exploration of family history and emotional healing through art. Abrahamson's work often reflects the intersection of personal trauma and societal narratives, offering both introspection and broader cultural reflection.

Teaching and education
Abrahamson has been an influential figure in art education, teaching at various institutions. She has taught at the University of Calgary, Red Deer College, and the University of Waterloo, and currently leads the Colour Theory and Painting courses at Sheridan College in Ontario. She is also the lead facilitator of the Sheridan Art Hives initiative, a community-focused project that promotes creativity through the use of recycled materials.

Body of work
Abrahamson's work was influenced by a sojourn in Mexico in 1993, where she and a colleague experienced the Day of the Dead festival. Out of that experience, she and her colleague created a special exhibition entitled Revival shown at the Muttart Gallery. Subsequently, they had a second exhibition, Days of the Dead at The New Gallery in Calgary. Abrahamson portrayed the symbolism of this festival.
Through her extensive course of studies in ceramic art, Kirsten Abrahamson has both an understanding of ceramic traditions and the formal skills in ceramic arts developed from the 19th through to the 21st century. Her foremost work, Diary of a River, has been the subject of critical analysis.

That work was reviewed in a short book by Carol Podedworny. Podedworny observed that Abrahamson's work reflects the California Funk and Bay Area Ceramics traditions and that Abrahamson's ""bold, satirical and colourful leanings are reflected in her narrative and figurative works that have a strong personal introspective penchant"". The use of low-fire clay and glazes permit the construction of large objects and brighter colours.
Similarly, Virginia Eichorn's article, about Diary of a River, featured in ESPACE SCULPTURE, observed that Abrahamson's studio work takes an autobiographical approach in the creation of ceramic art that reflects the themes in her life. 
Diary of a River was subsequently acquired by the Alberta Foundation for the Arts as part of its permanent collection. A number of her other works have been also been acquired by the Alberta Foundation for the Arts.
Abrahamson's ceramic art is illustrated and exemplified in several ceramics texts. One of these is Gail Crawford's book Studio Ceramics in Canada, a standard reference text published with the assistance of the Gardiner Museum, the only museum in Canada dedicated to ceramic art. The text discusses and illustrates Canadian ceramic art work and ceramic artists in Canada. Kirsten Abrahamson's glazing work has also been used for illustrative purposes in two books by professional studio potter Robin Hopper.

Film studies,"Film studies is an academic discipline that deals with various theoretical, historical, and critical approaches to cinema as an art form and a medium. It is sometimes subsumed within media studies and is often compared to television studies.
Film studies is less concerned with advancing proficiency in film production than it is with exploring the narrative, artistic, cultural, economic, and political implications of the cinema. In searching for these social-ideological values, film studies takes a series of critical approaches for the analysis of production, theoretical framework, context, and creation. Also, in studying film, possible careers include critic or production. Overall the study of film continues to grow, as does the industry on which it focuses.
Academic journals publishing film studies work include Sight & Sound, Film Comment, Film International, CineAction, Screen, Journal of Cinema and Media Studies, Film Quarterly, Projections: The Journal for Movies and Mind, and Journal of Film and Video.

History
Film studies as an academic discipline emerged in the 20th century, decades after the invention of motion pictures. Rather than focusing on the technical aspects of film production, film studies are concentrated on film theory, which approaches film critically as an art, and the writing of film historiography. Because film became an invention and industry only in the late 19th century, a generation of film producers and directors existed significantly before the academic analysis that followed in later generations.
Early film schools focused on the production and subjective critique of film rather than on the critical approaches, history and theory used to study academically. The concept of film studies arose as a means of analyzing the formal aspects of film as the films were created. Established in 1919, the Moscow Film School was the first school in the world to focus on film. In the United States, the USC School of Cinematic Arts, established in 1929, was the first cinematic-based school, which was created in agreement with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. It was also the first to offer an academic major in film in 1932, but the program lacked many of the distinctions associated with contemporary film study. Universities began to implement cinema-related curricula without separation of the abstract and practical approaches.
The German Deutsche Filmakademie Babelsberg was founded during the era of the Third Reich in 1938. Its lecturers included Willi Forst and Heinrich George. Students were required to create films in order to complete their studies at the academy.
A movement away from Hollywood productions in the 1950s turned cinema into a more artistic independent endeavor. It was the creation of the auteur theory, which examines film as the director's vision and art, that broadened the scope of academic film studies to a worldwide presence in the 1960s. In 1965, film critic Robin Wood, in his writings on Alfred Hitchcock, declared that Hitchcock's films contained the same complexities of Shakespeare's plays. Similarly, French director Jean Luc Godard, a contributor to the influential magazine Cahiers du Cinéma, wrote: ""Jerry Lewis [...] is the only one in Hollywood doing something different, the only one who isn't falling in with the established categories, the norms, the principles. [...] Lewis is the only one today who's making courageous films.""
A catalyst in the success and stature of academic film studies has been large donations to universities by successful commercial filmmakers. For example, director George Lucas donated $175 million to the USC School of Cinematic Arts in 2006.

Modern film studies
Today, film studies are taught worldwide and has grown to encompass numerous methods for teaching history, culture and society. Many liberal arts colleges and universities, as well as American high schools, contain courses specifically focused on the analysis of film. Modern-day film studies increasingly reflect popular culture and art, and a wide variety of curricula have emerged for analysis of critical approaches used in film. Students are typically expected to form the ability to detect conceptual shifts in film, a vocabulary for the analysis of film form and style, a sense of ideological dimensions of film and an awareness of extra textual domains and possible direction of film in the future. Universities often allow students to participate in film research and attend seminars of specialized topics to enhance their critical abilities.

Beel,"A beel (Bengali and Assamese: বিল) is a billabong or a lake-like wetland with static water as opposed to moving water in rivers and canals - typically called khāls in Bengali, in the Ganges - Brahmaputra flood plains of Bangladesh, and the Indian states of West Bengal and Assam. The term owes its origins to the word of the same pronunciation meaning ""pond"" and ""lake"" in the Bengali and Assamese languages.

Formation
Typically, beels are formed by inundation of low-lying lands during flooding, where some water gets trapped even after flood waters recede back from the flood plains. Beels may also be caused by filling up of low-lying areas during rains, especially during the monsoon season.
There are different causes for the formation of beels. A string of beels is indicative of there being the remains of a great river that deserted its channel, moving to a new one elsewhere.

Haor, Baor
In north eastern Bangladesh there are large water bodies called haors. A haor  is a bowl shaped depression which is flooded every year during monsoon. Throughout the rainy season a haor is such a vast stretch of turbulent water that it is thought of as a sea, within which the villages appear as islands. It remains under water for seven months of the year. During the dry season water drains out leaving small shallow lakes exposing rich soil extensively cultivated for rice. In greater Comilla, Faridpur, Dhaka and Pabna districts the beel is sometimes referred to as baor.

Location of important beels
Bangladesh
Bangladesh has thousands of beels, with the best-known being Chalan Beel, Beel Dakatia, Gopalganj-Khulna Beel, Meda Beel, Aila beel, Dekhar beel, Kuri beel, Erali beel and Arial Beel. In the central part Bangladesh, important beels are Katla, Chatal, Nagarkanda, and Chanda. Most of the large beels have shrunk a great deal in recent decades. Regionwise, in the northwest of Bangladesh some of the larger beels are Bara Beel in Pirganj, Tagrai Beel in Kurigram, Lunipukur in Rangpur, Bara Mirzapur Beel in Narail and Keshpathar in Bogra. The old river course of Atrai has beels. In the southern region of Bangladesh, important beels are Boyra, Dakatia, Bara, Kola, Patla, Chatal and Srirampur.

Assam
In Assam, Deepor Beel is a permanent, freshwater lake, in a former channel of the Brahmaputra river, to the south of the main river south-west of Guwahati. It has great biological and environmental importance besides being the only major storm water storage basin for the Guwahati city. The beel is endowed with rich floral and faunal diversity. In addition to huge congregation of residential water birds, the Deepor ecosystem harbours large number of migratory waterfowl each year. Deepor Beel has been designated as a Ramsar site in November 2002.

Mountain warfare,"Mountain warfare or alpine warfare is warfare in mountains or similarly rough terrain. The term encompasses military operations affected by the terrain, hazards, and factors of combat and movement through rough terrain, as well as the strategies and tactics used by military forces in these situations and environments.
Mountain ranges are of strategic importance since they often act as a natural border and may also be the origin of a water source such as the Golan Heights. Attacking a prepared enemy position in mountain terrain generally requires a greater ratio of attacking soldiers to defending soldiers than a war conducted on level ground. Mountains present natural hazards such as lightning, strong gusts of wind, rockfalls, avalanches, snowpacks, ice, extreme cold, and glaciers with their crevasses; in these ways, it can be similar to cold-weather warfare. The generally uneven terrain and the slow pace of troop and material movements are additional threats to combatants. Movement, reinforcements, and medical evacuation up and down steep slopes and areas in which even pack animals cannot reach involves an enormous exertion of energy.

History
Second Punic War
In 218 BC, the Carthaginian army commander Hannibal marched troops, cavalry and African elephants across the Alps in an effort to conquer Rome by approaching it from north of the Italian Peninsula. The Roman government was complacent because the Alps were viewed as a secure natural obstacle to would-be invaders. In December 218 BC, the Carthaginian forces defeated Roman troops, in the north, with the use of elephants. Many elephants did not survive the cold weather and disease typical of the European climate. Hannibal's army fought Roman troops in Italy for 15 years but failed to conquer Rome. Carthage was ultimately defeated by Roman general Scipio Africanus at Zama in North Africa in 202 BC.

Early modern history
The term mountain warfare is said to have come about in the Middle Ages after the European monarchies found it difficult to fight the armies of the Old Swiss Confederacy in the Alps. The Swiss fought in smaller units and took vantage points against a huge unmaneuverable army. Similar styles of attack and defence were later employed by guerrillas, partisans and irregulars, who hid in the mountains after an attack, which made it challenging for an army of regulars to fight back. In Napoleon Bonaparte's Italian campaign, Alexander Suvorov's Italian and Swiss expedition and the 1809 rebellion in Tyrol, mountain warfare played a large role.
Another example of mountain warfare was the Crossing of the Andes, which was carried out by the Argentinean Army of the Andes (Spanish: Ejército de los Andes), commanded by General José de San Martín in 1817. One of the divisions climbed mountains surpassing 5000 meters in height.
The Caucasian War was a 19th century military conflict between the Russian Empire and various peoples of the North Caucasus who resisted subjugation during the Russian conquest of the Caucasus.
The first British invasion of Afghanistan ended in 1842, when 16,000 British soldiers and camp followers were killed as they retreated from Kabul through the Hindu Kush back to India.

World War I
Mountain warfare came to the fore once again during World War I, when some of the nations that were involved in the war had mountain divisions that had not been tested. The Austro-Hungarian defence repelled Italian attacks by taking advantage of the terrain in the Julian Alps and the Dolomites, where frostbite and avalanches proved deadlier than bullets. During the summer of 1918, the Battle of San Matteo took place on the Italian front and was fought at the highest elevation of any during the war. In December 1914, another offensive was launched by the Ottoman supreme commander Enver Pasha with 95,000–190,000 troops against the Russians in the Caucasus. Insisting on a frontal attack against Russian positions in the mountains in the heart of winter, the result was devastating, and Enver lost 86% of his forces.

World War II
Examples of mountain warfare used during World War II include the Battles of Narvik, Battle of the Caucasus, Kokoda Track campaign, Battle of Attu, Operation Rentier, Operation Gauntlet, Operation Encore, and the British defence at the Battle of Hong Kong.
One ambush tactic used against the Germans during the Battles of Narvik utilised hairpin bends. Defenders would position themselves above them and open fire when attackers reached a certain point below, parallel to themselves. This would force the attackers to retreat, to continue under fire, or to attempt to climb the mountain another way. The tactic could be planned in advance, or employed by a retreating force.
Another tactic utilised was the 'ascending platoon attack'. Attackers would scout higher enemy positions from the ground, aided by bad weather or poor visibility. A light machine gun team would open fire towards the high enemy position from a distance, offering cover ",Mountains,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_warfare,1,mountain warfare alpine warfare warfare mountain similarly rough terrain term encompasses military operation affected terrain hazard factor combat movement rough terrain well strategy tactic used military force situation environment mountain range strategic importance since often act natural border may also origin water source golan height attacking prepared enemy position mountain terrain generally requires greater ratio attacking soldier defending soldier war conducted level ground mountain present natural hazard lightning strong gust wind rockfalls avalanche snowpacks ice extreme cold glacier crevasse way similar coldweather warfare generally uneven terrain slow pace troop material movement additional threat combatant movement reinforcement medical evacuation steep slope area even pack animal reach involves enormous exertion energy history second punic war bc carthaginian army commander hannibal marched troop cavalry african elephant across alp effort conquer rome approaching north italian peninsula roman government complacent alp viewed secure natural obstacle wouldbe invader december bc carthaginian force defeated roman troop north use elephant many elephant survive cold weather disease typical european climate hannibal army fought roman troop italy year failed conquer rome carthage ultimately defeated roman general scipio africanus zama north africa bc early modern history term mountain warfare said come middle age european monarchy found difficult fight army old swiss confederacy alp swiss fought smaller unit took vantage point huge unmaneuverable army similar style attack defence later employed guerrilla partisan irregular hid mountain attack made challenging army regular fight back napoleon bonaparte italian campaign alexander suvorovs italian swiss expedition rebellion tyrol mountain warfare played large role another example mountain warfare crossing andes carried argentinean army andes spanish ejército de los andes commanded general josé de san martín one division climbed mountain surpassing meter height caucasian war th century military conflict russian empire various people north caucasus resisted subjugation russian conquest caucasus first british invasion afghanistan ended british soldier camp follower killed retreated kabul hindu kush back india world war mountain warfare came fore world war nation involved war mountain division tested austrohungarian defence repelled italian attack taking advantage terrain julian alp dolomite frostbite avalanche proved deadlier bullet summer battle san matteo took place italian front fought highest elevation war december another offensive launched ottoman supreme commander enver pasha – troop russian caucasus insisting frontal attack russian position mountain heart winter result devastating enver lost force world war ii example mountain warfare used world war ii include battle narvik battle caucasus kokoda track campaign battle attu operation rentier operation gauntlet operation encore british defence battle hong kong one ambush tactic used german battle narvik utilised hairpin bend defender would position open fire attacker reached certain point parallel would force attacker retreat continue fire attempt climb mountain another way tactic could planned advance employed retreating force another tactic utilised ascending platoon attack attacker would scout higher enemy position ground aided bad weather poor visibility light machine gun team would open fire towards high enemy position distance offering cover
Architectural painting,"Architectural painting (also Architecture painting) is a form of genre painting where the predominant focus lies on architecture, including both outdoor and interior views. While architecture was present in many of the earliest paintings and illuminations, it was mainly used as background or to provide rhythm to a painting. In the Renaissance, architecture was used to emphasize the perspective and create a sense of depth, like in Masaccio's Holy Trinity from the 1420s.

In Western art, architectural painting as an independent genre developed in the 16th century in Flanders and the Netherlands, and reached its peak in 16th and 17th century Dutch painting. Later, it developed in a tool for Romantic paintings, with e.g. views of ruins becoming very popular. Closely related genres are architectural fantasies and trompe-l'oeils, especially illusionistic ceiling painting, and cityscapes.

Western artists specialized in architectural painting
16th century
The 16th century saw the development of architectural painting as a separate genre in Western art. The main centers in this period were Flanders and the Netherlands. The first important architectural painter was Dutch Hans Vredeman de Vries (1527–1607), who was both an architect and a painter. Students of Hans Vredeman de Vries, both in Flanders and in the Netherlands, include his sons Salomon and Paul, and Hendrik van Steenwijk I. Through them the genre was popularized and their family and students turned it into one of the main domains of Dutch Golden Age painting.

Chicago Painter,"The Chicago Painter was an ancient Greek vase painter, active in Athens, Greece, in the middle of the 5th century BCE. His real name is unknown, but like many other ancient Greek vase painters, his style was recognized in several works by the British classical archaeologist and international authority of Attic Greek vases, Sir John Beazley (1885–1970). Beazley was exceptionally talented at identifying the individual signature styles of different Greek painters, which could be recognized in something as subtle as the composition of eyes, noses, or hands. 

The Chicago Painter was one of many ancient Greek painters identified by Beazley, who first identified this stamnos to the artist in his 1918 publication Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums. The painter was originally called the “Painter of the Chicago Stamnos,” which was shortened to the “Chicago Painter.” His ""name vase"" is this large stamnos (mixing jar) that was acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1889 and was the first example of his work to be identified. The Chicago Painter was a follower  of the Villa Giulia Painter (a painter named after a distinct vase in the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome, Italy) and he had a preference for depicting elegant and tender scenes where the figures are calm and focused on their individual tasks. The stamnos at the Art Institute, along with others that the Chicago Painter decorated, depicts scenes likely related to the cult of the wine god Dionysos, and highlights his uncluttered, elegant signature style.

Freestyle (art exhibition),"Freestyle is an art exhibition by Japanese artist Satoshi Ohno, member of musical group Arashi. The first edition took place in 2008 in Omotesando Hills. Two more editions took place in 2015 and 2020 in Japan, as well as one in Shanghai in 2015.

Freestyle beginnings
""Freestyle"" ran from February 21 to 29, 2008, at Omotesando Hills Space O in Tokyo, with an expected number of 30,000 visitors. It included over 200 works in several forms. Many of Ohno's works created before he had entered Johnny & Associates, exhibited in Freestyle, included paintings, clay models, photographs, big objects d'art, and more. Ohno created all these works as part of his hobby, many done in his spare time, in off-days, between performances with his group, or acting break moments. When the exhibition opened, Ohno said ""It's a strange feeling to have so many people see the work that I have been making for 10 years in such... big venue"". A companion book, also named ""Freestyle"", was released days before, on February 8, and by the time the exhibition opened, it was already on its third printing.
In May, the exhibition changed name to ""Freestyle All Around Japan"", opening in Osaka (Kyocera Dome Osaka 9F Sky Hall, May 14–18), Nagoya (Asunal Hall, May 28- June 1), Tokyo (JCB Hall, June 12–15), Sapporo (Sapporo Dome, in front of the West Gate Special venue) and Fukuoka (Zepp Fukuoka, June 18–22).

Freestyle II
In 2015, Ohno announced a second edition of his art exhibition. With the name ""Freestyle II"", it would open in Tokyo, at Omotesando Space O, from July 24 to August 23, and Osaka from March 3 to April 3, 2016, after seven and a half years of the first one, which was visited by around 100,000 people in 6 venues. This time, 30 new works would be included in the exhibit: 15 figures and 15 paintings, some of the latter being oil paintings, a first for Ohno. As with the first one, a companion book would also be released, this time on July 24, taking the name of the exhibition. The book sold 115,000 units in the first week.
From July 9 to 29, Ohno's art would also be displayed in Shanghai, at the Shanghai Johhan Art Museum. This one, named as ""Freestyle in Shanghai 2015"", would include several of the works seen in ""Freestyle"", around 50-60 sculptures and 20 paintings. It was Ohno's first overseas art exhibition. About it, Ohno's comment was:  “I did not imagine holding an exhibit overseas. I wonder what kind of reaction would they have?”. In just the first day, the exhibition hosted 1,600 people, and by the day before, over 24,000 advance tickets had been sold. Ohno traveled from Japan on the 5th-6th to check on the venue, where he wrote on red paint ""Xie Xie"", saying: ""I'm looking forward to seeing how the people of Shanghai will view it and what their reactions will be.""

Freestyle 2020
5 years later, in 2020, amidst the chaos brought by the COVID-19 pandemic, Ohno held the last exhibition before taking a break from public activities. ""Freestyle 2020"" was held from September 9 to November 8 at Roppongi Hills Observatory Tokyo City View in Tokyo. His comment about it: ""This show will include previous works and a lot of newer ones, too. Looking back on my earlier works and spending time with them brought back lots of memories. From these past works, to the latest ones, FREESTYLE 2020 is packed with my latest thoughts and ideas. I hope everyone will find something to enjoy there”. The exhibition contained from miniature paintings, to a large head sculpture, to the painting of what would become Arashi's single ""Kite"" cover image. Later that year, it was revealed that the exhibition would be taken to the virtual world. Held on December 11, Ohno would take the digital visitors on a tour looking around through his works. It was also revealed that the physical exhibition would take place in Osaka's Grand Front Osaka, from December 21 to February 28, 2021, exclusively for members of Arashi's fan club, with projects and new goods unique to the Osaka venue.
As with the previous two events, a companion book was released by the time of the opening of the exhibition. The book ranked first in the ""Oricon Weekly Book Ranking"" dated October 19, after selling 40,000 units the first week of sales.
In addition to the exhibition, this year's event also had another thing close to Ohno's heart. It had been a dream of his to become a baker, and this year, in ""Cafe The Sun"", the café located next to the exhibition venue, a ""bakery"" was installed for the duration of the event, under the name ""Satoshi's Curry Bread Bakery"". The bakery offered curry bread with Ohno's original curry recipe. The recipe written on a recipe card was also enclosed with the purchase inside the paper bag as a bonus.

Inner city,"The term inner city (also called the hood) has been used, especially in the United States, as a euphemism for majority-minority lower-income residential districts that often refer to rundown neighborhoods, in a downtown or city centre area. Sociologists sometimes turn the euphemism into a formal designation by applying the term inner city to such residential areas, rather than to more geographically central commercial districts, often referred to by terms like downtown or city centre.

History
The term inner city first achieved consistent usage through the writings of white liberal Protestants in the U.S. after World War II, contrasting with the growing affluent suburbs. According to urban historian Bench Ansfield, the term signified both a bounded geographic construct and a set of cultural pathologies inscribed onto urban black communities. Inner city originated as a term of containment. Its genesis was the product of an era when a largely white suburban mainline Protestantism was negotiating its relationship to American cities. Liberal Protestants' missionary brand of urban renewal refocused attention away from the blight and structural obsolescence thought to be responsible for urban decay, and instead brought into focus the cultural pathologies they mapped onto black neighborhoods. The term inner city arose in this racial liberal context, providing a rhetorical and ideological tool for articulating the role of the church in the nationwide project of urban renewal. Thus, even as it arose in contexts aiming to entice mainline Protestantism back into the cities it had fled, the term accrued its meaning by generating symbolic and geographic distance between white liberal churches and the black communities they sought to help.

Urban renewal
Urban renewal (also called urban regeneration in the United Kingdom and urban redevelopment in the United States) is a program of land redevelopment often used to address urban decay in cities. Urban renewal is the clearing out of blighted areas in inner cities to create opportunities for higher class housing, businesses, and more.
In Canada, in the 1970s, the government introduced Neighbourhood Improvement Programs to deal with urban decay, especially in inner cities. Also, some inner-city areas in various places have undergone the socioeconomic process of gentrification, especially since the 1990s.

Deepsea mining in Namibia,"Namibia is one of the first countries that issued mining licences regarding deep sea mining. studies that took place in 1970s discovered considerable amounts of phosphate deposits. The significance of seabed mining in Namibia's blue economy is highlighted by the country's status as a ""phosphate factory"". This is due to the exceptional upwellings of the Benguela Current ecosystem, a transboundary ocean current that spans from South Africa in the south to Angola in the north, passing through Namibia. Those deposits were found in depths between 180 and 300 meters below the sea level. In 2011 the Namibian government issued licences regarding the exploitation of the seabed phosphate resources after the necessary Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs). The action plan that stood out was that of Namibian Marine Phosphates (NMP), a joint venture formed in 2008 between two Australian-based companies, Minemakers and Union Resources (each with 42.5% shareholding) and Namibian-based Tungeni Investments (15% shareholding). The so-called Sandpiper phosphate mining project outlay was introduced in January 2012 along with environmental reports regarding the effect this operation would have on marine life as well as the fishing industry and water quality changes. Those phosphorite resources are being found in continental shelves and slopes in America, Northern Spain, Morocco, Namibia, and South Africa which show a high potential for exploration.
The urge of exploring and exploiting deep sea mineral resources has come from the demand and the shortage of phosphate on the markets. Specifically, fertilizers, which are a market that is heavily dependent on phosphate resources, has seen its prices skyrocket due to this shortage. This demand tied with the quality and density of the deep-sea resources in Namibia's seabed has made the willingness of resource exploitation in the area even more prominent. Furthermore, the resources in Namibia waters are very close to the potential markets that are interested in acquiring those metals which will diminish transportation costs adding another dimension on why exploiting those resources is critical for the markets. Additionally when the excavation technology is finished the ships and the tools used for extraction will be mobile and they can travel to various areas that were deemed rich in minerals. This mobility will be a revelation in mining in comparison to the immobility of land mining.

Namibia's phosphate resources
Namibia's shelf contains different phosphate resources such as Diagenetic phosphorite, which originated by phosphitylation of carbonate rocks and biogenic debris, forms a 0.5 m thick pavement across large parts of the shelf off the southern tip of Africa. This phosphorites can be found on the seabed as pebbles, and gravel-sized, irregular fragments, which originally consisted of foraminiferal limestone, glauconitic, or limonitic sandstone. The age of phosphitylation varies from the earliest Miocene to the Quaternary. Although there is a variety of phosphate minerals in Namibia the most common one is found in sand form pellets on the organic rich muds of the seabed. Those pellets can be found as a continuous layer in the Namibian waters at approximately 180 to 300 meters below the sea level. In the Namibia's case the formation consists of two layers. The first layer which is closer to the seabed surface has a thickness of 0.1–1.0 m and consists of coarse molluscan shell debris embedded in a dark brown matrix of fine-sandy phosphoric pellets. The shell fragments decrease in size and abundance with depth and the pellets while the mud content increase. The second layer is found as ions in Miocene clays. Those are thicker than the surface ones and their history and reasons of existence are still poorly understood.

Other resources
Apart from phosphate resources Namibia seabed is filled with rare earth elements were the ocean environment has kept and preserved minerals such as copper, nickel, manganese and other in very big sizes and higher grade quality than most of the earth resources. As mentioned above there are a number of companies that seem willing to invest in researching and exploiting the deep sea in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ). Although the gains of exploiting the deep sea bed of Namibia may be incredible, it is not yet clear how efficient the mining technology in such depth would be. With deep mining technology being in the works companies although noticing the huge potential there is not any engages in the CCZ zone. One company that is interested and has already carried out in areas associated with deep sea mining is Nautilus Minerals. Nautilus minerals has also been involved in explorations of deep sea in Papua New Guinea and Tonga and they primary mining focus are copper and gold. Those explorations for the potential mining process uses proven technologies of offshore gas extraction establishments.

International date line in Judaism,"The international date line in Judaism is used to demarcate the change of one calendar day to the next in the Jewish calendar. It is not necessarily the same as the internationally recognised International Date Line (IDL - which is 180° from the Greenwich Meridian, passing through London, UK). On the east side of the IDL it is one day, on the west side it is the next. 
However, the conventional International Date Line is a relatively recent geographic and political construct whose exact location has moved from time to time depending on the needs of different interested parties. While it is well-understood why the conventional date line is located in the Pacific Ocean, there are not really objective criteria for its exact placement within the Pacific. In that light, it cannot be taken for granted that the conventional International Date Line can (or should) be used as a date line under Jewish law. In practice, within Judaism the halakhic date line is similar to, but not necessarily identical with, the conventional Date Line, and the differences can have consequences under religious law.

Location of the date line
Theoretical basis for the discussion
Many of the opinions about the halakhic date line are structured as a response to the question of what days someone should observe as Shabbat and Jewish holidays. Shabbat occurs every seven days at any location on Earth. It is normally thought to occur on Saturday—or more precisely, from Friday at sundown to Saturday at nightfall. But if the halakhic date line is not identical to the conventional Date Line, it is possible that what is Saturday with respect to the conventional Date Line is not Saturday with respect to the halakhic date line, at least in some places.
There are several opinions regarding where exactly the halakhic date line should be according to Jewish law, and at least one opinion that says that no halakhic date line really exists.
1. 90 degrees east of Jerusalem. The concept of a halakhic date line is mentioned in the Baal HaMeor, a 12th-century Talmudic commentary, which seems to indicate that the day changes in an area where the time is six hours ahead of Jerusalem (90 degrees east of Jerusalem, about 125.2°E, a line now known to run through Australia, the Philippines, China and Russia). This line, which he refers to as the K'tzai Hamizrach (the easternmost line), is used to calculate the day of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year. According to some sources it is alluded to in both the Babylonian Talmud (Rosh Hashanah and Eruvin) and in the Jerusalem Talmud. The Kuzari of Yehuda Halevi, also a 12th-century work, seems to agree with this ruling.
Later decisors like the Chazon Ish (twentieth century) fundamentally agree with this ruling. However, they recognize practical issues associated with the pure use of a line of longitude for this purpose. As an example, 125.2°E passes directly through Dongfeng Street in Changchun, China. If this line of longitude were used strictly, people could simply avoid Shabbat altogether by crossing the street. To prevent that, the Chazon Ish rules that the contiguous land masses to the east of that line of longitude are considered secondary (tafel) to the land masses west of that line. As a result, he rules that the date line runs along 125.2°E when over water, but curves around the eastern coast of mainland Asia and Australia. By this view, Russia, China and mainland Australia are west of the date line and observe Shabbat on local Saturday. Japan, New Zealand and Tasmania are east of the date line and should observe Shabbat on local Sunday, as defined by the conventional International Date Line. By this view, the Philippines and Indonesia would have portions west of the line and portions east of the line.
2. 180 degrees east of Jerusalem. Rabbi Yechiel Michel Tucazinsky ruled that the International Date Line is 180 degrees east of Jerusalem. That would mean that the date line, rather than being near 180°, would be at 144.8°W. By this view, places east of the conventional International Date Line but west of 144.8°W—Alaska, Hawaii and a variety of archipelagos in the Pacific—would observe Shabbat on the local Friday instead of the local Saturday.
It is possible (but not certain) under this view to apply the principle of tafel described above as well. In that event, mainland Alaska would be east of the date line, but the Aleutian Islands would be west of the date line.
3. Mid-Pacific. A variety of decisors rule that the date line runs in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, close to (but not necessarily the same as) the conventional International Date Line. According to this point of view, all of the major populated areas of the Pacific (such as New Zealand, Japan, Alaska and Hawaii) observe Shabbat on local Saturday (that is, consistent with the conventional International Date Line). Only certain Pacific islands, generally having few or no permanent Jewish residents, might not observe Shabbat on local Saturday.

City marketing,"City marketing (related to city branding) or Place Marketing is the promotion of a city, or a district within it, with the aim of encouraging certain activities to take place there (such as tourism and attraction of foreign direct investments).
Place  marketing  ""refers  to  the  application  of  marketing  instruments  to  geographical locations, such  as  cities,  towns,  regions  and  communities i.e. coordinated  use  of  marketing  tools  supported  by  a  shared customer-oriented  philosophy,  for  creating,  communicating,  delivering  and  exchanging urban  offerings  that  have  value  for  the  city's  customers  and  the  city's  community  at  large"".
The orchestrated attempt to differentiate place (city/ town or cities) aims at associating through:

Design: describing place as a character
Infrastructure: describing place as a fixed environment
Basic services: place as a service provider
Attraction: place as entertainment or recreation
It is used to alter the external perceptions of a city in order to encourage tourism, attract inward migration of residents, or enable business relocation. A significant feature of city marketing is the development of new landmark, or 'flagship', buildings and structures. The development of cities as a marketable product has led to competition between them for inward investment and government funding. It is often manifested in the attempts by cities to attract international sporting events, such as the Olympic Games. Competition between cities exists at the regional, national and international level; and is an effect of globalisation.Some places are associated with certain brands and build on each other, but sometimes the commercial brand is so powerful that eclipses the place brand. An example of this is Maranello, Italy, which uses the Ferrari headquarters as a primary attraction for tourists.
City marketing can occur strategically or organically. An example of strategic city marketing is Las Vegas. The city is promoted through a variety of efforts with the strategic intent of acquiring cultural and economic bonuses. A case of organic city marketing is Jerusalem. The city is marketed without a grand strategy, as disorganized stakeholders over the course of centuries have glorified the city and encouraged pilgrimage, yielding cultural and economic bonuses. Both cases demonstrate city marketing, each with varying strategic and organic involvement. Generally, organic marketing occurs alongside strategic marketing, as the perception of the city is impossible to solely construct with strategic efforts.
According to Scott Cutlip, ""one of the first, if not the first, municipal promotion programs"" was led by Erastus Brainerd for the city of Seattle beginning in 1896. Seattle was in competition with Portland and Victoria as the preferred city in which to get supplied for the Klondike Gold Rush. A Bureau of Public Information was established within the city's Chamber of Commerce.
Like with any successful marketing effort, cities must be willing to commit to a long-term plan in order for their identity and message to be communicated effectively. A shared vision between stakeholders will help develop a cohesive overarching strategy for a city's image.

City Brand Index
The City Brand Index is released biannually and ranks the image of 50 cities on 6 components: presence, place, potential, pulse, people, and prerequisites. In the 2015 report, Paris took the top spot, with London, New York, Sydney, and Los Angeles taking the 2nd–5th spots respectively.

Central business district,"A central business district (CBD) is the commercial and business center of a city. It contains commercial space and offices, and in larger cities will often be described as a financial district. Geographically, it often coincides with the ""city centre"" or ""downtown"". However, these concepts are not necessarily synonymous: many cities have a central business district located away from its traditional city center, and there may be multiple CBDs within a single urban area. The CBD will often be highly accessible and have a large variety and concentration of specialised goods and services compared to other parts of the city. Midtown Manhattan is the world's largest central business district. In the City of London, the largest concentration of economic output in the world is held there, with many headquarters of major financial and law firms being based in the City.

In Chicago, the Chicago Loop is the second-largest central business district in the United States. It is also referred to as the core of the city's downtown.
Mexico City also has its own historic city center, the colonial era ""Centro Histórico"", along with two CBDs: the mid-late 20th century Paseo de la Reforma in Polanco, and the new Santa Fe, respectively. Russia's largest central business district is the Moscow International Business Center in Moscow.
The shape and type of a central business district almost always closely reflect the city's history. Cities with strong preservation laws and maximum building height restrictions to retain the character of the historic and cultural core may have a CBD quite a distance from the city centre (and in some cases, outside the city limits itself). This distinction is quite common in European cities such as: London, Paris, Moscow, Vienna, Prague and Budapest. The New World grew quickly after the emergence of modern transport, therefore a single centre often included many of the region's tallest buildings and served as both a commercial and cultural city centre.

In the 21st century, increasing urbanisation has led to the development of megacities that often have multiple CBDs scattered across the urban area. Downtown sections of cities, especially in North America, often are distinct from CBDs and city centres. No two CBDs have the same spatial shape, but there are certain common geometric patterns, which are largely a result of centralised commercial and industrial activities.

Australia
In Australia, the term CBD is widely used officially and colloquially, in the sense of city centre. The three biggest cities, Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane have large CBDs. Sydney features growing micro central business districts, which serve as the hub for their respective areas outside the CBD. An example is Parramatta (which is considered the financial hub of Western Sydney), Chatswood and North Sydney. Also on the outskirts of Brisbane, within Brisbane-Gold Coast urban area with a population of three million, a new micro central business district being created in Southport.

Brazil
São Paulo is a multipolar city, with several business districts. Avenida Faria Lima and the neighboring districts, Itaim Bibi and Vila Olímpia, now concentrate a large part of the financial activities in São Paulo and Brazil. Avenida Paulista and nearby streets is a well-established financial center that has several banking offices and corporate headquarters, as well as hospitals. Its Historic Center was the city's first business center; There, the São Paulo Stock Exchange is located. The region comprising Avenidas Berrini, Doutor Chucri Zaidan, and Nações Unidas, the city's newest commercial district, has offices of multinational companies and also commercial services.
In Rio de Janeiro, Brazil's second-largest city, the main business district still is in downtown, where Petrobrás and Vale headquarters are located, but there is a concentration of business in Botafogo harbor and in Barra da Tijuca, a newer Rio de Janeiro suburb located in city's west region.

"Netflix, Inc.","Netflix, Inc. is an American media company founded in 1997 by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph in Scotts Valley, California, and currently based in Los Gatos, California, with production offices and stages at the Los Angeles-based Hollywood studios (formerly old Warner Brothers studios) and the Albuquerque Studios (formerly ABQ studios). It owns and operates an eponymous over-the-top subscription video on-demand service, which showcases acquired and original programming as well as third-party content licensed from other production companies and distributors. Netflix is also the first streaming media company to be a member of the Motion Picture Association.
Netflix initially both sold and rented DVDs by mail, but the sales were eliminated within a year to focus on the DVD rental business. In 2007, Netflix introduced streaming media and video on demand. The company expanded to Canada in 2010, followed by Latin America and the Caribbean. In 2011, the service began to acquire and produce original content, beginning with the crime drama Lilyhammer.
The company is ranked 117th on the Fortune 500 and 219th on the Forbes Global 2000. It is the second largest entertainment/media company by market capitalization as of February 2022. In 2021, Netflix was ranked as the eighth-most trusted brand globally by Morning Consult. During the 2010s, Netflix was the top-performing stock in the S&P 500 stock market index, with a total return of 3,693%.
The company has two CEOs, Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos, who are split between Los Gatos and Los Angeles, respectively. It also operates international offices in Asia, Europe and Latin America including in Canada, France, Brazil, the Netherlands, India, Italy, Japan, Poland, South Korea, and the United Kingdom. The company has production hubs in Los Angeles, Albuquerque, London, Madrid, Vancouver and Toronto.

History
Launch as a mail-based rental business (1997–2006)
Netflix was founded by Marc Randolph and Reed Hastings on August 29, 1997, in Scotts Valley, California. Hastings, a computer scientist and mathematician, was a cofounder of Pure Software, which was acquired by Rational Software that year for $750 million, the then biggest acquisition in Silicon Valley history. Randolph had worked as a marketing director for Pure Software after Pure Atria acquired a company where Randolph worked. He was previously a co-founder of MicroWarehouse, a computer mail-order company as well as vice president of marketing for Borland. Hastings and Randolph came up with the idea for Netflix while carpooling between their homes in Santa Cruz, California, and Pure Atria's headquarters in Sunnyvale. Patty McCord, later head of human resources at Netflix, was also in the carpool group. Randolph admired Amazon and wanted to find a large category of portable items to sell over the Internet using a similar model. Hastings and Randolph considered and rejected selling and renting VHS as too expensive to stock and too delicate to ship. When they heard about DVDs, first introduced in the United States in early 1997, they tested the concept of selling or renting DVDs by mail by mailing a compact disc to Hastings's house in Santa Cruz. When the disc arrived intact, they decided to enter the $16 billion Home-video sales and rental industry. Hastings is often quoted saying that he decided to start Netflix after being fined $40 at a Blockbuster store for being late to return a copy of Apollo 13, a claim since repudiated by Randolph. Hastings invested $2.5 million into Netflix from the sale of Pure Atria. Netflix launched as the first DVD rental and sales website with 30 employees and 925 titles available—nearly all DVDs published. Randolph and Hastings met with Jeff Bezos, where Amazon offered to acquire Netflix for between $14 and $16 million. Fearing competition from Amazon, Randolph at first thought the offer was fair, but Hastings, who owned 70% of the company, turned it down on the plane ride home.
Initially, Netflix offered a per-rental model for each DVD but introduced a monthly subscription concept in September 1999. The per-rental model was dropped by early 2000, allowing the company to focus on the business model of flat-fee unlimited rentals without due dates, late fees, shipping and handling fees, or per-title rental fees. In September 2000, during the dot-com bubble, while Netflix was suffering losses, Hastings and Randolph offered to sell the company to Blockbuster for $50 million. John Antioco, CEO of Blockbuster, thought the offer was a joke and declined, saying, ""The dot-com hysteria is completely overblown."" While Netflix experienced fast growth in early 2001, the continued effects of the dot-com bubble collapse and the September 11 attacks caused the company to hold off plans for its initial public offering (IPO) and to lay off one-third of its 120 employees.

The Math(s) Fix,"The Math(s) Fix: An Education Blueprint for the AI Age is a 2020 book by British technologist and entrepreneur Conrad Wolfram. It argues for a fundamental shift in the way mathematics education is taught in schools, advocating for a curriculum that emphasizes a computational education and computer-based mathematics education for 21st-century problem-solving skills with computers in the classroom, rather than manual handwritten calculation techniques.

History of cities,"Towns and cities have a long history, although opinions vary on which ancient settlements are truly cities. Historically, the benefits of dense, permanent settlement were numerous, but required prohibitive amounts of food and labor to maintain. Ancient cities allowed for the pooling of resources, exchange of ideas, large marketplaces, and even some shared amenities such as drinking water, sewerage, law enforcement, and roads. The first cities formed and grew once these benefits of proximity between people exceeded the cost of work required to maintain a settlement. Various technologies such as bricks, pottery, and animal taming played a large role in the costs and benefits of maintaining the earliest forms of cities. Cities were first made possible by advances in  technology.

Origins
There is not enough evidence to assert with certainty what conditions gave rise to the first cities. Smaller human settlements (such as villages) pre-date cities by many thousands of years. Before permanent settlement in cities, there were also large temporary settlements used for religious purposes or as a stopping place for nomadic people.  
Anthropologists speculate on what they consider suitable pre-conditions and basic mechanisms that might have been important driving forces in the shift to permanent settlement. The conventional view holds that cities first formed after the Neolithic Revolution, and the introduction of agriculture. The ability to produce food from a fixed location made permanent settlements much more attractive to ancient people. However, whether farming immigrants replaced foragers or foragers began farming is not clear. The increased food production per unit of land supported higher population density and more city-like activities in areas suitable for agriculture. In the book, Cities and Economic Development, Paul Bairoch takes up this position in his argument that agriculture and a surplus of food is necessary before cities can form. 

According to V. Gordon Childe, for a settlement to qualify as a city, it must have enough surplus of raw materials to support trade and a relatively large population. Bairoch points out that, due to sparse population densities that would have persisted in pre-Neolithic, hunter-gatherer societies, the amount of land that would be required to produce enough food for subsistence and trade for a large population would make it impossible to control the flow of trade. To illustrate this point, Bairoch offers an example: ""Western Europe during the pre-Neolithic, [where] the density must have been less than 0.1 person per square kilometre"". Using this population density as a base for calculation, and allotting 10% of food towards surplus for trade and assuming that city dwellers do no farming, he calculates that ""...to maintain a city with a population of 1,000, and without taking the cost of transport into account, an area of 100,000 square kilometres would have been required. When the cost of transport is taken into account, the figure rises to 200,000 square kilometres ..."". Bairoch noted that this is roughly the size of Great Britain. The urban theorist Jane Jacobs suggests that city formation preceded the birth of agriculture, but this view is not widely accepted.
In his book City Economics, Brendan O'Flaherty asserts ""Cities could persist—as they have for thousands of years—only if their advantages offset the disadvantages"". O'Flaherty illustrates two similar attracting advantages known as increasing returns to scale and economies of scale, which are concepts usually associated with businesses. Their applications are seen in more basic economic systems as well. Increasing returns to scale occurs when ""doubling all inputs more than doubles the output [and] an activity has economies of scale if doubling output less than doubles cost"".
Similarly, ""Are Cities Dying?"", a paper by Harvard economist Edward L. Glaeser, delves into similar reasons for city formation: reduced transport costs for goods, people and ideas. Discussing the benefits of proximity, Glaeser claims that if a city is doubled in size, workers get a ten percent increase in earnings. Glaeser furthers his argument by stating that bigger cities do not pay more for equal productivity than in a smaller city, so it is reasonable to assume that workers become more productive if they move to a city twice the size as they initially worked in. The workers do not benefit much from the ten percent wage increase, because it is recycled back into the higher cost of living in a larger city.

Childe’s ten criteria
The first true towns are sometimes considered large settlements where the inhabitants were no longer simply farmers of the surrounding area, but began to take on specialized occupations, and where trade, food storage and power were centralized. In 1950 Gordon Childe attempted to define a historic city with ten general metrics. These are:

Size and density of the population should be above normal.

Transcontinental railroad,"A transcontinental railroad or transcontinental railway is contiguous railroad trackage that crosses a continental land mass and has terminals at different oceans or continental borders. Such networks may be via the tracks of a single railroad, or via several railroads owned or controlled by multiple railway companies along a continuous route. Although Europe is crisscrossed by railways, the railroads within Europe are usually not considered transcontinental, with the possible exception of the historic Orient Express.
Transcontinental railroads helped open up interior regions of continents not previously colonized to exploration and settlement that would not otherwise have been feasible. In many cases, they also formed the backbones of cross-country passenger and freight transportation networks. Many of them continue to have an important role in freight transportation, and some such as the Trans-Siberian Railway even have passenger trains going from one end to the other.

Africa
East-west
There are several ways to cross Africa transcontinentally via connecting east–west railways. One is the Benguela railway, completed in 1929. It starts in Lobito, Angola, and connects through Katanga to the Zambia railways system. From Zambia several ports are accessible on the Indian Ocean: Dar es Salaam in Tanzania through the TAZARA, and, through Zimbabwe, Beira and Maputo in Mozambique. The Angolan Civil War made the Benguela line largely inoperative, but efforts are being taken to restore it. Another west–east corridor leads from the Atlantic harbours in Namibia, either Walvis Bay or Luderitz to the South African rail system that, in turn, links to ports on the Indian Ocean ( i.e. Durban, Maputo).
A 1015 km gap in the east–west line between Kinshasa and Ilebo is filled by riverboats.  It could be plugged if a new railway were to be built, as was discussed in 2009.
There are two proposals for a line from the Red Sea to the Gulf of Guinea, including TransAfricaRail.
In 2010, a proposal sought to link Dakar to Port Sudan. Thirteen countries would be on the main route; another six would be served by branches.

North-south
A north-south transcontinental railway had been proposed by Cecil Rhodes, who termed it the Cape-Cairo railway. This system would act as a direct route from the northernmost British possession in Africa, Egypt, to the southernmost one, the Cape Colony. The project was never completed. During its development, a competing French colonial project for a competing line from Algiers or Dakar to Abidjan was abandoned after the Fashoda incident. This line would have had four gauge islands in three gauges.
An extension of Namibian Railways is being built in 2006 with the possible connection to Angolan Railways.
Libya has proposed a Trans-Saharan Railway connecting possibly to Nigeria which would connect with the proposed AfricaRail network.

African Union of Railways
The African Union of Railways has plans to connect the various railways of Africa including the Dakar-Port Sudan Railway.

Australia
East-west
Australia's east–west transcontinental rail corridor, consisting of lines built to three different track gauges, was completed in 1917, when the Trans-Australian Railway was opened between Port Augusta, South Australia and Kalgoorlie, Western Australia. This line, built by the federal government as a federation commitment, filled the last gap in the lines between the mainland state capitals of Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth. Passengers and freight alike suffered from time-consuming breaks of gauge: a Perth–Brisbane journey at that time involved two standard gauge 1435 mm (4 ft 81⁄2 in) lines, a broad gauge 1600 mm (5 ft 3 in) line, and three of 1067 mm (3 ft 6 in) gauge.
In the 1940s and 1960s, steps were taken to progressively reduce the huge inefficiencies caused by the numerous historically imposed breaks of gauge by linking the mainland capital cities with lines all of standard gauge.
In 1970, the route across the continent was completed to standard gauge and a new, all-through passenger train, the Indian Pacific was inaugurated.
An east–west transcontinental line across northern Australia from the Pilbara to the east coast – more than 1000 km (600 mi) north of the Sydney-Perth rail corridor – was proposed in 2006 by Project Iron Boomerang to connect iron ore mining in the Pilbara and coal mining in the Bowen Basin in Queensland, with steel manufacturing plants at both ends.

North–south
Australia's north–south transcontinental rail corridor was built in stages during the 20th century, leaving a 1420-kilometre (880-mile) gap to be finished after the 828 kilometres (514 miles) Tarcoola to Alice Springs section was completed in 1980. That final section, from Alice Springs to Darwin, was opened in 2004. The total length of the corridor, from Adelaide to Darwin, is 2975 kilometres (1849 miles). Completion of the corridor ended 126 years of freight and passengers alike having to be transferred b",Continents,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcontinental_railroad,1,transcontinental railroad transcontinental railway contiguous railroad trackage cross continental land mass terminal different ocean continental border network may via track single railroad via several railroad owned controlled multiple railway company along continuous route although europe crisscrossed railway railroad within europe usually considered transcontinental possible exception historic orient express transcontinental railroad helped open interior region continent previously colonized exploration settlement would otherwise feasible many case also formed backbone crosscountry passenger freight transportation network many continue important role freight transportation transsiberian railway even passenger train going one end africa eastwest several way cross africa transcontinentally via connecting east–west railway one benguela railway completed start lobito angola connects katanga zambia railway system zambia several port accessible indian ocean dar e salaam tanzania tazara zimbabwe beira maputo mozambique angolan civil war made benguela line largely inoperative effort taken restore another west–east corridor lead atlantic harbour namibia either walvis bay luderitz south african rail system turn link port indian ocean ie durban maputo km gap east–west line kinshasa ilebo filled riverboats could plugged new railway built discussed two proposal line red sea gulf guinea including transafricarail proposal sought link dakar port sudan thirteen country would main route another six would served branch northsouth northsouth transcontinental railway proposed cecil rhodes termed capecairo railway system would act direct route northernmost british possession africa egypt southernmost one cape colony project never completed development competing french colonial project competing line algiers dakar abidjan abandoned fashoda incident line would four gauge island three gauge extension namibian railway built possible connection angolan railway libya proposed transsaharan railway connecting possibly nigeria would connect proposed africarail network african union railway african union railway plan connect various railway africa including dakarport sudan railway australia eastwest australia east–west transcontinental rail corridor consisting line built three different track gauge completed transaustralian railway opened port augusta south australia kalgoorlie western australia line built federal government federation commitment filled last gap line mainland state capital brisbane sydney melbourne adelaide perth passenger freight alike suffered timeconsuming break gauge perth–brisbane journey time involved two standard gauge mm ft ⁄ line broad gauge mm ft line three mm ft gauge step taken progressively reduce huge inefficiency caused numerous historically imposed break gauge linking mainland capital city line standard gauge route across continent completed standard gauge new allthrough passenger train indian pacific inaugurated east–west transcontinental line across northern australia pilbara east coast – km mi north sydneyperth rail corridor – proposed project iron boomerang connect iron ore mining pilbara coal mining bowen basin queensland steel manufacturing plant end north–south australia north–south transcontinental rail corridor built stage th century leaving kilometre mile gap finished kilometre mile tarcoola alice spring section completed final section alice spring darwin opened total length corridor adelaide darwin kilometre mile completion corridor ended year freight passenger alike transferred b
Promontory,"A promontory is a raised mass of land that projects into a lowland or a body of water (in which case it is a peninsula). Most promontories either are formed from a hard ridge of rock that has resisted the erosive forces that have removed the softer rock to the sides of it, or are the high ground that remains between two river valleys where they form a confluence. One type of promontory is a headland, or head.

Promontories in history
Located at the edge of a landmass, promontories offer a natural defense against enemies, as they are often surrounded by water and difficult to access. Many ancient and modern forts and castles have been built on promontories for this reason.

One of the most famous examples of promontory forts is the Citadel of Namur in Belgium. Located at the confluence of the Meuse and Sambre rivers, the citadel has been a prime fortified location since the 10th century. The surrounding rivers act as a natural moat, making it difficult for enemies to access the fort.
Another example of a promontory fort is Fort Pitt, which was built by the English during the American Revolution on the site of the former Fort Duquesne, which belonged to the French during the French and Indian War. The fort was located at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers, providing an additional layer of defense. The surrounding area eventually became the city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
In Ireland, many promontory forts were built by the ancient Celts for defense against invaders. These forts were often located on isolated peninsulas or headlands and were difficult to access, making them ideal for defending against enemy attacks.
The ancient town of Ras Bar Balla in southern Somalia is another example of a promontory fort. Located on a small promontory, the town was part of the Ajuran Sultanate's domain during the Middle Ages and was strategically located to defend against potential invaders.

Extreme environment,"An extreme environment is a habitat that is considered very hard to survive in due to its considerably extreme conditions such as temperature, accessibility to different energy sources or under high pressure. For an area to be considered an extreme environment, it must contain certain conditions and aspects that are considered very hard for other life forms to survive. Pressure conditions may be extremely high or low; high or low content of oxygen or carbon dioxide in the atmosphere; high levels of radiation, acidity, or alkalinity; absence of water; water containing a high concentration of salt; the presence of sulphur, petroleum, and other toxic substances.
Examples of extreme environments include the geographical poles, very arid deserts, volcanoes, deep ocean trenches, upper atmosphere, outer space, and the environments of every planet in the Solar System except the Earth. Any organisms living in these conditions are often very well adapted to their living circumstances, which is usually a result of long-term evolution. Physiologists have long known that organisms living in extreme environments are especially likely to exhibit clear examples of evolutionary adaptation because of the presumably intense past natural selection they have experienced.

On Earth
The distribution of extreme environments on Earth has varied through geological time. Humans generally do not inhabit extreme environments. There are organisms referred to as extremophiles that do live in such conditions and are so well-adapted that they readily grow and multiply. Extreme environments are usually hard to survive in.

Beyond Earth
Most of the moons and planets in the Solar System are also extreme environments. Astrobiologists have not yet found life in any environments beyond Earth, though experiments have shown that tardigrades can survive the harsh vacuum and intense radiation of outer space. The conceptual modification of  conditions in locations beyond Earth, to make them more habitable by humans and other terrestrial organisms, is known as terraforming.

Types
Among extreme environments are places that are alkaline, acidic, or unusually hot or cold or salty, or without water or oxygen. There are also places altered by humans, such as mine tailings or oil impacted habitats.

Alkaline: broadly conceived as natural habitats above pH 9 whether persistently, or with regular frequency or for protracted periods of time.
Acidic: broadly conceived as natural habitats below pH 5 whether persistently, or with regular frequency or for protracted periods of time.
Extremely cold: broadly conceived habitats periodically or consistently below -17 °C either persistently, or with regular frequency or for protracted periods of time. Includes montane sites, polar sites, and deep ocean habitats.
Extremely hot: broadly conceived habitats periodically or consistently in excess of 40 °C either persistently, or with regular frequency or for protracted periods of time. Includes sites with geothermal influences such as Yellowstone and comparable locations worldwide or deep-sea vents.
Hypersaline:  environments with salt concentrations greater than that of seawater, that is, >3.5%. Includes salt lakes.
Under pressure: broadly conceived as habitats under extreme hydrostatic pressure –  i.e. aquatic habitats deeper than 2000 meters and enclosed habitats under pressure. Includes habitats in oceans and deep lakes.
Radiation: broadly conceived as habitats exposed to abnormally high radiation or of radiation outside the normal range of light. Includes habitats exposed to high UV and IR radiation.
Without water: broadly conceived as habitats without free water whether persistently, or with regular frequency or for protracted periods of time. Includes hot and cold desert environments, and some endolithic habitats
Without oxygen: broadly conceived as habitats without free oxygen – whether persistently, or with regular frequency, or for protracted periods of time. Includes habitats in deeper sediments.
Altered by humans: i.e. anthropogenically impacted habitats. Includes mine tailings, oil impacted habitats, and pollution by heavy metals or organic compounds.
Without light: deep ocean environments and habitats such as caves.
Void of food: areas on earth that lack an abundance of food such as the vast ocean, desert and high country.
Extreme pressure: deep ocean areas

Extreme habitats
Many different habitats can be considered extreme environments, such as the polar ice caps, the driest spots in deserts, and abysmal depths in the ocean. Many different places on the Earth demand that species become highly specialized if they are to survive. In particular, microscopic organisms that can't be seen with the naked eye often thrive in surprising places.

Polar regions
Owing to the dangerously low temperatures, the number of species that can survive in these remote areas is very slim.

Pseudo-atoll,"A pseudo-atoll, like an atoll, is an island that encircles a lagoon, either partially or completely. A pseudo-atoll differs from an atoll as established by several authorities, such as how it is formed (not by subsidence, nor by coral). It is considered a preferable term to ""near-atoll"". There is a need for rigorous definition of ""pseudo-atoll"" before it can be accepted as a general term.

Definitions
Alexander Agassiz gave the term pseudo-atoll to ""any ring-shaped reefs not formed as a result of subsidence"". while Norman D. Newell and J. Keith Rigby called such reefs non-coral. and ""We conclude that almost-atoll should be retained as a descriptive term as defined by Davis and Tayama, and that the use of ""near-atoll"" as a synonym be abandoned. The value of terms such as ""semi-atoll"" and ""pseudo-atoll"" needs close examination and more rigorous definition before being generally accepted."" H. Mergner yet states that micro-atolls classify as pseudo-atolls. Professor David R. Stoddart of Berkeley states an ""almost-atoll"" is an atoll with a central island of left over residue.

Usage
Dr. Edward J. Petuch, author of Cenozoic seas: the view from eastern North America, refers to pseudo-atolls as pseudoatolls with the Everglades Pseudoatoll as an example.

Tudum,"Tudum: A Global Fan Event, also known as Netflix Tudum or Tudum Festival, is a global pop culture event that covers Netflix's original films and television series held annually in São Paulo, Brazil (except from the 2nd to the 4th editions, which had an online format due to the COVID-19 pandemic) until 2025, when it was held in Los Angeles.
Held for the first time in January 2020, the event is presented by Maisa Silva and brings singers, actors and actresses from Netflix to promote new work, meet and play with the Brazilian public. The name of the event comes from the onomatopoetic word that refers to the sound trademark of Netflix (/tədʌm/).

History
In-person format
First edition
The first edition, in January 2020, was held in São Paulo, Brazil, with a public of over 50,000 people during the four days and big names from the original Netflix productions such as Lana Condor, Noah Centineo, Larissa Manoela and Jottapê, with concerts by brazilian pop stars Anavitória, Melim, Projota, Kevin o Chris, Gretchen and Tropkillaz. The event brought together sets from various series, such as Stranger Things, Sex Education and Sintonia, so that the public had an immersive experience and could feel part of their favorite series.

Online format
Second edition
The second edition, in November 2020, was carried out entirely online, given the circumstances of social distancing and quarantine caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Netflix decided to create an online version of the festival hosted by the brazilian multimedia Maisa Silva and names of their original productions such as Ashley Park, Lucas Bravo, Joel Courtney and Leah Lewis with concerts by brazilian starts Marília Mendonça, Pabllo Vittar, Emicida, Jottapê and Mila. The event also gained an Almanac version that was distributed physically and digitally, with the aim of expanding the event and covering the entire national territory. Netflix held the virtual edition for free as well as distributing 100,000 copies of an almanac with several stories, games and activities about the series and movies.

Third edition
The third edition, in September 2021, was named ""Tudum: A Global Fan Event"", an online event that includes audiences from other countries. The event was broadcast on YouTube, Facebook and Twitch on September 25.

Fourth edition
The event was broadcast on September 24, 2022.

Mixed format
Fifth edition
The event took place from June 16 to 18, 2023. It returned to the face-to-face format of the first edition, taking place again in the Ibirapuera Park, in São Paulo; but with a simultaneous live global online broadcasting on YouTube of the outdoors main panel in June 17, hosted one more time by Maisa Silva, but now accompanied by co-hosts Outer Banks' Chase Stokes and Never Have I Ever's Maitreyi Ramakrishnan. It brought big names from the original Netflix productions such as Chris Hemsworth, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Benedict Wong, Zack Snyder, Gal Gadot and Henry Cavill, as well as the main cast of One Piece.

Sixth edition
The 2025 edition was held on May 31 at the Kia Forum in Greater Los Angeles, United States and was the first time that the event has a more globally perspective.Unlike the previous editions, the event was broadcast live by Netflix.  Lady Gaga performed at the event, and Cookie Monster from Sesame Street appeared in the event to promote the upcoming 56th season.

Tudum (website)
On December 9, 2021, Netflix announced the launch of Tudum.com, an official companion website named after the annual event, a public relations service offering news, lists, interviews, editorials, and behind-the-scenes videos for its television shows and films.

Submerged continent,"A submerged continent or a sunken continent is a region of continental crust, extensive in size but mainly undersea. The terminology is used by some paleogeologists and geographers in reference to some landmasses (none of which are as large as any of the seven generally-recognized continents).
The definition of this term is unclear. If continental fragments and microcontinents smaller than 2,500,000 km2 (970,000 sq mi), which is approximately one third of the area of mainland Australia, are excluded, then Zealandia (approximately 4,900,000 km2 or 1,900,000 sq mi) would be the only geological feature which is classifiable as a submerged continent.
Other notable submerged lands include Beringia, Doggerland, the Kerguelen Plateau, Mauritia, Sahul, and Sunda.
Submerged continents have been sought and speculated about in regard to a possible ""lost continent"" underwater in the Atlantic Ocean. There was also a search in the 1930s for Lemuria, thought to have been a possible submerged continent between the Indian and African coasts.

Clearwater river (river type),"A clearwater river is classified based on its chemistry, sediments and water colour. Clearwater rivers have a low conductivity, relatively low levels of dissolved solids, typically have a neutral to slightly acidic pH and are very clear with a greenish colour. Clearwater rivers often have fast-flowing sections.
The main clearwater rivers are South American and have their source in the Brazilian Plateau or the Guiana Shield. Outside South America the classification is not commonly used, but rivers with clearwater characteristics are found elsewhere.
Amazonian rivers fall into three main categories: clearwater, blackwater and whitewater. This classification system was first proposed by Alfred Russel Wallace in 1853 based on water colour, but the types were more clearly defined according to chemistry and physics by Harald Sioli from the 1950s to the 1980s. Although many Amazonian rivers fall clearly into one of these categories, others show a mix of characteristics and may vary depending on season and flood levels.

Location
The main clearwater rivers are South American and have their source in the Brazilian Plateau or the Guiana Shield. Examples of clearwater rivers originating in the Brazilian Plateau include Tapajós, Xingu, Tocantins, several large right-bank tributaries of the Madeira (notably Guaporé, Ji-Paraná and Aripuanã) and Paraguay (although heavily influenced by its whitewater tributaries). The Tapajós and Xingu alone account for 6% and 5%, respectively, of the water in the Amazon basin. Examples of clearwater rivers originating in the Guiana Shield include the upper Orinoco (above the inflow of the blackwater Atabapo and whitewater Inírida–Guaviare), Ventuari, Nhamundá, Trombetas, Paru, Araguari and Suriname.
Outside South America the classification is not commonly used, but rivers with clearwater characteristics are found elsewhere, such as the upper Zambezi River, certain upland streams in major river basins of South and Southeast Asia, and many streams of northern Australia.

Chemistry and sediments
In South America, clearwater rivers typically have their source and flow through regions with sandy soils and crystalline rocks. These are generally ancient, of Precambrian origin, and therefore heavily weathered, allowing relatively few sediments to be dissolved in the water. This results in the low conductivity, relatively low levels of dissolved solids and clear colour typical of clearwater rivers.
Sand and kaolinite are the typical sediments transported by clearwater rivers, similar to blackwater, but unlike whitewater that also transports high levels of illite and montmorillonite, resulting in a significantly higher fertility of places influenced by the latter river type. Nevertheless, although clearwater rivers can have extremely low nutrient levels similar to blackwater, some such as the Tapajós, Xingu and Tocantins have nutrient levels that are intermediate between black and whitewater. The exact chemistry of clearwater rivers varies, but it is often very similar to rainwater, low in major nutrients with sodium as the relatively dominating chemical.
The water is typically neutral to slightly acidic, but the pH can range between 4.5 and 8. In the Amazon basin, clearwater rivers flowing through regions with sediments of Tertiary age are typically highly acidic, while those flowing through sediments of Carboniferous age are closer to neutral or slightly basic.
As suggested by the name, clearwater rivers are highly transparent with a typical visibility of 1.5–4 m (5–13 ft). There can be large variations, even within a single river, depending on season or heavy rains.

Ecology

The difference in chemistry and visibility between the various black, white and clearwater rivers result in distinct differences in flora and fauna. Although there is considerable overlap in the fauna found in the different river types, there are also many species found only in one of them. Many blackwater and clearwater species are restricted to relatively small parts of the Amazon, as different blackwater and clearwater systems are separated (and therefore isolated) by large whitewater sections. These ""barriers"" are considered a main force in allopatric speciation in the Amazon basin.

Many species of fish, which often are threatened (especially by dams), are only known from clearwater rivers. Large sections with rapids are home to specialized, rheophilic fish, as well as aquatic plants such as Podostemaceae. There are major differences in the amount of macrophytes and this is mainly related to light: heavily shaded clearwater rivers have few, while those flowing through more open regions often contain many. Clearwater rivers have relatively low productivity compared to whitewater rivers, resulting in a comparably low insect abundance.

City limits,"City limits or city boundaries refer to the defined boundary or border of a city. The area within the city limit can be called the city proper. Town limit/boundary and village limit/boundary apply to towns and villages. Similarly, corporate limit is a legal name that refers to the boundary of municipal corporations. In some countries, the limit of a municipality may be expanded through annexation.

United Kingdom
In the UK, city boundaries are more difficult to define, and the specific concept of a city boundary as opposed to e.g. a town or borough boundary, is less useful: British cities are defined as any town or local authority area, regardless of area or population size, that has been granted letters patent as a royal prerogative. In smaller cities, such as Wells (pop. approx. 10,000) or Gloucester (pop. approx. 100,000), the boundary will be that governed by the city council, though in certain cases such as Carlisle, this may include large rural and even uninhabited areas which are largely distinct from the main settlement. In the case of larger cities, such as Birmingham (pop. approx. 1,000,000), local government will be administered by a metropolitan borough but the wider metro area may also have a county or regional combined authority. London, the largest city, is the original model for this in the UK: almost all of the metropolitan area (known as Greater London) is governed by the Greater London Authority. However, as a regional administration its powers are limited, and the 32 boroughs plus the ancient City of London contained within it are responsible for the majority of services.
Although British city (or borough) boundaries are often important for defining local services such as refuse collection and planning (zoning), in most places they form a low level of local government. Law enforcement, education and other services are generally defined by county boundaries (or larger areas), and central government is responsible for the National Health Service (NHS Scotland or NHS Wales outside of England).
Planning (zoning) law around British cities is generally determined by green belt laws, which prevent building on the countryside surrounding large and medium-sized towns and cities.

United States
In the United States, such limits are usually formally described in a state, provincial, or territorial law (or an appropriate regulation) as being under the control of the municipal corporation or agency that constitutes the city government. It is customary to indicate city limits with signs on freeways, highways, and arterial roads.
Property within a city limit is subject to city taxation and city regulation, and expects city services. Areas outside any city's limit are considered to be unincorporated, and in most U.S. states they are by default regulated and taxed by the county. In others, areas outside a city's limit fall within another type of local government, such as the civil township (a division of a county). Cities and towns may have extraterritorial jurisdiction beyond their limits, typically for zoning purposes. The distance this extends varies based on the population or area of the city, or which ""class"" it is considered to be under state law.
Home rule within a city's limit is usually exercised by the mayor (executive branch) and city council (legislative branch). Home rule outside the city's limit is usually exercised by the county commission (which is often both legislative and executive), or the township's board of supervisors. Even without home rule, the county, as a unit of state government, also has certain powers and responsibilities even within the limits of its cities, including the sheriff that performs evictions, runs the county jail that all city and county police departments take arrested persons to, and guards the courthouse for the county's state court even though it is usually within the city limit of the county seat. Elections and health departments are also common county responsibilities which include all cities. (City residents still pay some county taxes for these reasons.)
If a city chooses to have its own emergency services, they generally only operate within the city's limit, except for mutual aid (typically among fire departments) in case of disaster. Telephone companies also must keep track of changing a city's limit to ensure that calls to 9-1-1 are routed to the appropriate public-safety answering point, if the city operates a PSAP separate from the county. Calls from mobile phones are usually routed based on the location of the base station rather than the calling party, so these (along with landline calls to non-emergency telephone numbers) must be handled manually by the telephone operator or dispatcher, determining whether the caller or incident is within a particular city limit or not so that the proper authorities may be sent.
A city's limit may extend into more than one county, which can complicate certain matters of policing and taxation.

Entrenched river,"An entrenched river, or entrenched stream is a river or stream that flows in a narrow trench or valley cut into a plain or relatively level upland. Because of lateral erosion streams flowing over gentle slopes over a time develops meandering (snake like pattern) course. Meanders form where gradient is very gentle, for example in floodplains and deltas. Meandering is a feature of the middle and final course of the river, but very deep and wide meanders can also be found cutting hard rocks. Such meanders are called incised or entrenched meanders. The exception is entrenched meanders that are formed during the upliftment of land where a river is young. They widen and deepen over time and can be found as deep gorges or canyons in hard rock. 
In the case of an entrenched stream or river, it is often presumed that the watercourse has inherited its course by cutting down into bedrock from a pre-existing plain with little modification of the original course. The down-cutting of the river system could be the result not only of tectonic uplift but also of other factors such as river piracy, decrease of load, increase of runoff, extension of the drainage basin, or change in base level such as a fall in sea level. General, non-generic terminology for either a river or stream that flows in a narrow trench or valley, for which evidence of a preexisting plain or relatively level upland can be either absent or present is either valley meander or meander valley with the latter term being preferred in literature.
The meanders that form part of either an entrenched river or meander valley are most commonly known as incised meanders. They are commonly classified as either an ingrown meander or an entrenched meander. For a long time, it was argued that ingrown meander occurs when the downcutting process is slow and the river can cause lateral erosion, leading to an asymmetric valley. In addition, it was also argued for a long time that an entrenched meander forms when there is a rapid incision of the river bed such that the river does not have the opportunity to erode the lateral side. This leads to symmetrical valleys with a gorge-like appearance. However, more detailed studies have shown the development of ingrown meanders versus entrenched meanders depends on a complex mixture of factors such as bedrock lithology, tectonic activity, and climate.

Causes
As observed above, an entrenched river can be caused by either tectonic uplift in the area or when the lowering of the sea level occurs. It can also be caused by increased level of downcutting or a collapse of moraine-dammed lake downstream, or capture of the river by another river. Moreover, the process of river rejuvenation can also be the cause of river entrenchment, especially when the process has occurred due to tectonic uplift. River rejuvenation increases the power of the flowing water and, therefore, the process of erosion is accelerated.
Studies show that tectonic movement, particularly movement associated with uplift, can influence spatial patterns of erosion and sedimentation. Although it is very difficult to offer detailed information of past tectonic activity, the basic temporal and spatial scale can show evidence of how this movement leads to the formation of an entrenched river. Various authors have used an entrenched river as evidence of tectonic movement in the past, and in this way they have proven the significant role of tectonic uplifts in the formation of an entrenched river.
Several studies have cited incised meander a major feature of river entrenchment, as an impact of river rejuvenation. On the other hand, scholars argue that incised meanders and entrenched meanders are features formed before river rejuvenation. Incised meanders occur at the base of the river and they occur when the river base level has reduced, thus giving the river enough power for vertical erosion to take place. Some studies also indicate that anthropogenic factors such as clearing of vegetation, development of dams, and reservoir and urbanization are also causes of river entrenchment. For example, gravel mining along the Russian River developed the Middle Reach pit, which in turn led to the creation of the entrenched river. According to Posamentier, in the 1950s and 1980s, the Russian River had gravel pits and dry creek. However, over time the river has become entrenched due to mining (p. 1777).
Urbanization and clearing of vegetation increase runoff water, which in turn increases water volume, especially during rainy seasons. Therefore, the increased level of vertical erosion of the river increases the power of the water, leading to erosion of the river. A study of San Pedro River and another river in the southwest have indicated that floods were the main cause of river entrenchment in the 18th century. The study shows that increased population and human activities in these places increased floods and, consequently, the volume of runoff water (Hereford 43).

French standard sizes for oil paintings,"French standard sizes for oil paintings refers to a series of different sized canvases for use by artists. The sizes were fixed in the 19th century. Most artists—not only French—used this standard, as it was supported by the main suppliers of artist materials. Only some contemporary artist material suppliers continue to use these standards today, as most artists no longer differentiate canvas sizes by subject.
The main separation from size 0 (toile de 0) to size 120 (toile de 120) is divided in separate runs for faces/portraits (figure), landscapes (paysage), and marines (marine) which more or less keep the diagonal. That is, a figure 0 corresponds in height to a paysage 1 and a marine 2.
In modern times in the USA size is usually stated height by width, where as in this article it is width by height.

Chemical bath deposition,"Chemical bath deposition, also called chemical solution deposition and CBD, is a method of thin-film deposition (solids forming from a solution or gas), using an aqueous precursor solution. Chemical bath deposition typically forms films using heterogeneous nucleation (deposition or adsorption of aqueous ions onto a solid substrate), to form homogeneous thin films of metal chalcogenides (mostly oxides, sulfides, and selenides) and many less common ionic compounds. Chemical bath deposition produces films reliably, using a simple process with little infrastructure, at low temperature (<100 ˚C), and at low cost. Furthermore, chemical bath deposition can be employed for large-area batch processing or continuous deposition. Films produced by CBD are often used in semiconductors, photovoltaic cells, and supercapacitors, and there is increasing interest in using chemical bath deposition to create nanomaterials.

Uses
Chemical bath deposition is useful in industrial applications because it is extremely cheap, simple, and reliable compared to other methods of thin-film deposition, requiring only aqueous solution at (relatively) low temperatures and minimal infrastructure. The chemical bath deposition process can easily be scaled up to large-area batch processing or continuous deposition. 
Chemical bath deposition forms small crystals, which are less useful for semiconductors than the larger crystals created by other methods of thin-film deposition but are more useful for nano materials. However, films formed by chemical bath deposition often have better photovoltaic properties (band electron gap) than films of the same substance formed by other methods.

Historical Uses
Chemical bath deposition has a long history but until recently was an uncommon method of thin-film deposition. 
In 1865, Justus Liebig published an article describing the use of chemical bath deposition to silver mirrors (to affix a reflective layer of silver to the back of glass to form a mirror), though in the modern day electroplating and vacuum deposition are more common. 
Around WWII, lead sulfide (PbS) and lead selenide (PbSe) CBD films are thought to have been used in infrared detectors. These films are photoconductive when formed by chemical bath deposition.
Chemical bath deposition has a long history in forming thin films used in semiconductors as well. However the small size of deposited crystals is not ideal for semiconductors and chemical bath deposition is rarely used to manufacture semiconductors in the modern day.

Photovoltaics
Photovoltaic cells are the most common use of films deposited by chemical bath deposition because many films have better photovoltaic properties when deposited via CBD than when deposited by other methods. This is because thin films formed by chemical bath deposition exhibit greater size quantization, and therefore smaller crystals and a greater optical band gap, than thin films formed by other methods. These improved photovoltaic properties are why Cadmium Sulfide (CdS), a thin film common in photovoltaic cells, is the substance most commonly deposited by CBD and the substance most commonly investigated in CBD research papers.
Chemical bath deposition is also used to deposit buffer layers in photovoltaic cells because CBD does not damage the substrate.

Optics
Chemical bath deposition films can be made to absorb certain wavelengths and reflect or transmit others as desired. This is because films formed by Chemical Bath Deposition have an electronic bandgap which can be precisely controlled. This selective transmission can be used for anti-reflection and anti-dazzling coatings, solar thermal applications, optical filters, polarizers, total reflectors, etc. The films deposited by Chemical Bath Deposition have possible applications in anti-reflection, anti-dazzling, thermal control widow coatings, optical filters, total reflectors, poultry protection and warming coatings, light emitting diodes, solar cell fabrication, and varistors.

Nanomaterials
Chemical bath deposition or electroless deposition has great applications in the field of nanomaterials, because the small crystal size enables formation on the nanometer scale, because the properties and nanostructure of chemical bath deposition films can be precisely controlled, and because the uniform thickness, composition, and geometry of films deposited by chemical bath deposition allows the film to retain the structure of the substrate. The low cost and high reliability of chemical bath deposition even on the nanometer scale is unlike any other thin-film deposition technique. Chemical bath deposition can be used to produce polycrystalline and epitaxial films, porous networks, nanorods, superlattices, and composites.

Process
Chemical bath deposition relies on creating a solution such that deposition (changing from an aqueous to a solid substance) will only occur on the substrate, using the method below:

Mountain Day,"Mountain Day refers to three different and unrelated events: (1) Mountain Day, a student celebration in some colleges in the United States in which classes are cancelled without prior notice, and the student body heads to the mountains or a park, (2) International Mountain Day, held each year on 11 December, which was established by the UN General Assembly in 2003 to encourage sustainable development in mountains, and (3) Mountain Day, a national holiday in Japan as of 2016.

United States
Mountain Day dates back to at least 1838, when the students of Mount Holyoke College headed off to Mount Holyoke. Smith College declared its Mountain Day in 1877. Juniata College established its Mountain Day in 1896, and Williams College students have been climbing Mount Greylock, the highest mountain in Massachusetts, to celebrate Mountain Day since the 1800s. Colby-Sawyer College's Mountain Day is stated to have started in the 1850s, although the first account of it in the student newspaper is not listed until June 1893. Elmira College instituted Mountain Day in 1918.
Hollins University has a similar tradition called Tinker Day on which people don costumes and hike Tinker Mountain.

International (UN)
December 11, ""International Mountain Day"", was designated by the United Nations General Assembly in 2003. The General Assembly ""encouraged the international community to organize events at all levels on that day to highlight the importance of sustainable mountain development.""
International Mountain Day is observed every year with a different theme relevant to sustainable mountain development. FAO is the U.N. organization mandated to lead observance of International Mountain Day.
The theme for International Mountain Day 2010 was ""Mountain minorities and indigenous peoples."" It aims to raise awareness about indigenous peoples and minorities who live in mountain environments and the relevance of their cultural heritage, traditions and customs.
On International Mountain Day 2018, Josué Lorca, president of Venezuela’s National Parks Institute, traveled to the mountains of the Sierra Nevada de Mérida, to announce measures intended to lengthen the life of Venezuela's last remaining glacier.

Japan
In May 2014, it was announced that Mountain Day will be celebrated as a public holiday every August 11, beginning in 2016. Supporters of the holiday included legislator Seishiro Eto and the Japanese Alpine Club. The legislation states that the holiday is to provide ""opportunities to get familiar with mountains and appreciate blessings from mountains.""
As special arrangement for the 2020 Summer Olympics, the 2020 date for Mountain Day was moved to August 10. With the Olympics and Paralympics postponed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the government left this change in place for 2020 and passed an amendment to the Olympic and Paralympic Special Measures Act to make a corresponding change to the holiday in 2021, moving it to August 9.

Other
Armenia
In connection with the UN's International Mountain Day, Armenia has dedicated 9 October as ""Day of the Mountains.""

Physics,"Physics is the scientific study of matter, its fundamental constituents, its motion and behavior through space and time, and the related entities of energy and force. It is one of the most fundamental scientific disciplines. A scientist who specializes in the field of physics is called a physicist.
Physics is one of the oldest academic disciplines. Over much of the past two millennia, physics, chemistry, biology, and certain branches of mathematics were a part of natural philosophy, but during the Scientific Revolution in the 17th century, these natural sciences branched into separate research endeavors. Physics intersects with many interdisciplinary areas of research, such as biophysics and quantum chemistry, and the boundaries of physics are not rigidly defined. New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms studied by other sciences and suggest new avenues of research in these and other academic disciplines such as mathematics and philosophy.
Advances in physics often enable new technologies. For example, advances in the understanding of electromagnetism, solid-state physics, and nuclear physics led directly to the development of technologies that have transformed modern society, such as television, computers, domestic appliances, and nuclear weapons; advances in thermodynamics led to the development of industrialization; and advances in mechanics inspired the development of calculus.

History
The word physics comes from the Latin physica ('study of nature'), which itself is a borrowing of the Greek φυσική (phusikḗ 'natural science'), a term derived from φύσις (phúsis 'origin, nature, property').

Ancient astronomy
Astronomy is one of the oldest natural sciences. Early civilizations dating before 3000 BCE, such as the Sumerians, ancient Egyptians, and the Indus Valley Civilisation, had a predictive knowledge and a basic awareness of the motions of the Sun, Moon, and stars. The stars and planets, believed to represent gods, were often worshipped. While the explanations for the observed positions of the stars were often unscientific and lacking in evidence, these early observations laid the foundation for later astronomy, as the stars were found to traverse great circles across the sky, which could not explain the positions of the planets.
According to Asger Aaboe, the origins of Western astronomy can be found in Mesopotamia, and all Western efforts in the exact sciences are descended from late Babylonian astronomy. Egyptian astronomers left monuments showing knowledge of the constellations and the motions of the celestial bodies, while Greek poet Homer wrote of various celestial objects in his Iliad and Odyssey; later Greek astronomers provided names, which are still used today, for most constellations visible from the Northern Hemisphere.

Natural philosophy
Natural philosophy has its origins in Greece during the Archaic period (650 BCE – 480 BCE), when pre-Socratic philosophers like Thales rejected non-naturalistic explanations for natural phenomena and proclaimed that every event had a natural cause. They proposed ideas verified by reason and observation, and many of their hypotheses proved successful in experiment; for example, atomism was found to be correct approximately 2000 years after it was proposed by Leucippus and his pupil Democritus.

Aristotle and Hellenistic physics
During the classical period in Greece (6th, 5th and 4th centuries BCE) and in Hellenistic times, natural philosophy developed along many lines of inquiry. Aristotle (Greek: Ἀριστοτέλης, Aristotélēs) (384–322 BCE), a student of Plato,
wrote on many subjects, including a substantial treatise on ""Physics"" – in the 4th century BC.  Aristotelian physics was influential for about two millennia. His approach mixed some limited observation with logical deductive arguments, but did not rely on experimental verification of deduced statements.  Aristotle's foundational work in Physics, though very imperfect, formed a framework against which later thinkers further developed the field. His approach is entirely superseded today.
He explained ideas such as motion (and gravity) with the theory of four elements.
Aristotle believed that each of the four classical elements (air, fire, water, earth) had its own natural place.  Because of their differing densities, each element will revert to its own specific place in the atmosphere.  So, because of their weights, fire would be at the top, air underneath fire, then water, then lastly earth. He also stated that when a small amount of one element enters the natural place of another, the less abundant element will automatically go towards its own natural place.  For example, if there is a fire on the ground, the flames go up into the air in an attempt to go back into its natural place where it belongs.  His laws of motion included: that heavier objects will fall faster, the speed being proportional to the weight and the speed of the object that is falling depends inversely on the densit",Physics,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics,0,physic scientific study matter fundamental constituent motion behavior space time related entity energy force one fundamental scientific discipline scientist specializes field physic called physicist physic one oldest academic discipline much past two millennium physic chemistry biology certain branch mathematics part natural philosophy scientific revolution th century natural science branched separate research endeavor physic intersects many interdisciplinary area research biophysics quantum chemistry boundary physic rigidly defined new idea physic often explain fundamental mechanism studied science suggest new avenue research academic discipline mathematics philosophy advance physic often enable new technology example advance understanding electromagnetism solidstate physic nuclear physic led directly development technology transformed modern society television computer domestic appliance nuclear weapon advance thermodynamics led development industrialization advance mechanic inspired development calculus history word physic come latin physica study nature borrowing greek φυσική phusikḗ natural science term derived φύσις phúsis origin nature property ancient astronomy astronomy one oldest natural science early civilization dating bce sumerian ancient egyptian indus valley civilisation predictive knowledge basic awareness motion sun moon star star planet believed represent god often worshipped explanation observed position star often unscientific lacking evidence early observation laid foundation later astronomy star found traverse great circle across sky could explain position planet according asger aaboe origin western astronomy found mesopotamia western effort exact science descended late babylonian astronomy egyptian astronomer left monument showing knowledge constellation motion celestial body greek poet homer wrote various celestial object iliad odyssey later greek astronomer provided name still used today constellation visible northern hemisphere natural philosophy natural philosophy origin greece archaic period bce – bce presocratic philosopher like thales rejected nonnaturalistic explanation natural phenomenon proclaimed every event natural cause proposed idea verified reason observation many hypothesis proved successful experiment example atomism found correct approximately year proposed leucippus pupil democritus aristotle hellenistic physic classical period greece th th th century bce hellenistic time natural philosophy developed along many line inquiry aristotle greek ἀριστοτέλης aristotélēs – bce student plato wrote many subject including substantial treatise physic – th century bc aristotelian physic influential two millennium approach mixed limited observation logical deductive argument rely experimental verification deduced statement aristotle foundational work physic though imperfect formed framework later thinker developed field approach entirely superseded today explained idea motion gravity theory four element aristotle believed four classical element air fire water earth natural place differing density element revert specific place atmosphere weight fire would top air underneath fire water lastly earth also stated small amount one element enters natural place another less abundant element automatically go towards natural place example fire ground flame go air attempt go back natural place belongs law motion included heavier object fall faster speed proportional weight speed object falling depends inversely densit
Exploration,"Exploration is the process of exploring, an activity which has some expectation of discovery. Organised exploration is largely a human activity, but exploratory activity is common to most organisms capable of directed locomotion and the ability to learn, and has been described in, amongst others, social insects foraging behaviour, where feedback from returning individuals affects the activity of other members of the group.

Types
Geographical
Geographical exploration, sometimes considered the default meaning for the more general term exploration, is the practice of discovering lands and regions of the planet Earth remote or relatively inaccessible from the origin of the explorer. The surface of the Earth not covered by water has been relatively comprehensively explored, as access is generally relatively straightforward, but underwater and subterranean areas are far less known, and even at the surface, much is still to be discovered in detail in the more remote and inaccessible wilderness areas.
Two major eras of geographical exploration occurred in human history:  The first, covering most of Human history, saw people moving out of Africa, settling in new lands, and developing distinct cultures in relative isolation. Early explorers settled in Europe and Asia; about 14,000 years ago, some crossed the Ice Age land bridge from Siberia to Alaska, and moved southwards to settle in the Americas. For the most part, these cultures were ignorant of each other's existence. The second period of exploration, occurring over the last 10,000 years, saw increased cross-cultural exchange through trade and exploration, and marked a new era of cultural intermingling, and more recently, convergence.
Early writings about exploration date back to the 4th millennium B.C. in ancient Egypt. One of the earliest and most impactful thinkers on exploration was Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD. Between the 5th century and 15th century AD, most exploration was done by Chinese and Arab explorers. This was followed by the Age of Discovery after European scholars rediscovered the works of early Latin and Greek geographers. While the Age of Discovery was partly driven by land routes outside of Europe becoming unsafe, and a desire for conquest, the 17th century also saw exploration driven by nobler motives, including scientific discovery and the expansion of knowledge about the world. This broader knowledge of the world's geography meant that people were able to make world maps, depicting all land known. The first modern atlas was the Theatrum Orbis Terrarum, published by Abraham Ortelius, which included a world map that depicted all of Earth's continents.: 32

Underwater
Underwater exploration is the exploration of any underwater environment, either by direct observation by the explorer, or by remote observation and measurement under the direction of the investigators. Systematic, targeted exploration, with simultaneous survey, and recording of data, followed by data processing, interpretation and publication, is the most effective method to increase understanding of the ocean and other underwater regions, so they can be effectively managed, conserved, regulated, and their resources discovered, accessed, and used. Less than 10% of the ocean has been mapped in any detail, even less has been visually observed, and the total diversity of life and distribution of populations is similarly incompletely known.

Space
Space exploration is the use of astronomy and space technology to explore outer space. While the exploration of space is currently carried out mainly by astronomers with telescopes, its physical exploration is conducted both by uncrewed robotic space probes and human spaceflight. Space exploration, like its classical form astronomy, is one of the main sources for space science.
While the observation of objects in space, known as astronomy, predates reliable recorded history, it was the development of large and relatively efficient rockets during the mid-twentieth century that allowed physical extraterrestrial exploration to become a reality. Common rationales for exploring space include advancing scientific research, national prestige, uniting different nations, ensuring the future survival of humanity, and developing military and strategic advantages against other countries.

Urban
Urban exploration is the exploration of manmade structures, usually abandoned ruins or hidden components of the manmade environment. Photography and historical interest/documentation are heavily featured in the hobby, sometimes involving trespassing onto private property.
The activity presents various risks, including physical danger and, if done illegally and/or without permission, the possibility of arrest and punishment. Some activities associated with urban exploration violate local or regional laws and certain broadly interpreted anti-terrorism laws, or can be considered trespassing or invasion of privacy.

First island chain,"The first island chain is the first string of major Pacific archipelagos out from the East Asian continental mainland coast. It is principally composed of the Kuril Islands, the Japanese archipelago, the Ryukyu Islands, Taiwan (Formosa), the northern Philippines, and Borneo, hence extending all the way from the Kamchatka Peninsula in the northeast to the Malay Peninsula in the southwest. The first island chain forms one of three island chain doctrines within the island chain strategy in the U.S. foreign policy.

Much of the first island chain is roughly situated in waters claimed by the People's Republic of China (PRC). These include the South China Sea, within the nine-dash line, as well as the East China Sea west of the Okinawa Trough.

Strategic value
China
According to a 2018 United States Department of Defense report to Congress, the People's Liberation Army's Anti-Access/Area Denial military capabilities aimed at the first island chain are its most robust. The report also stated that the People's Liberation Army Navy's ability to perform missions beyond the first island chain is ""modest but growing as it gains experience operating in distant waters and acquires larger and more advanced platforms.""

Japan
Around 2009 Japanese military strategist Toshi Yoshihara and Naval War College professor James R. Holmes suggested the American military could exploit the geography of the first island chain to counter the People's Liberation Army Navy build-up. The Cabinet of Japan has also passed defense white papers emphasizing the threat posed by the People's Liberation Army Navy in the first island chain.
In the later years of the 2010s, Japan started deploying military assets to Yonaguni and its other islands to counter China's presence along that area of the first island chain.
Japan's strategic position in the first island chain began with US-Japan joint efforts to counter Soviet expansion. The Japan Self-Defense Forces currently plays the role of protecting US military bases and preserving military strength in East Asia. As for Japan's Territorial Protection Self-Defense Forces, which mainly rely on islands in southern Japan adjacent to the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea, Japan has military advantages in anti-submarine, air defense and sea mine technologies.

Philippines
In 2021, Lloyd Austin, on behalf of the United States, thanked his counterpart in the Philippines Delfin Lorenzana for retaining the 70-year-old visiting forces agreement between the two nations. In 2023 four new bases were announced in the Philippines.

Taiwan
In the first island chain, Taiwan is considered of critical strategic importance. It is located at the midpoint of the first chain and occupies a strategic position.

United States
U.S. General Douglas MacArthur pointed out that before World War II, the US protected its western shores with a line of defense from Hawaii, Guam, to the Philippines. However, this line of defense was attacked by Japan with the Pearl Harbor bombing of 1941, thereby drawing the U.S. into the war. The US subsequently launched the air Raid on Taipei (called Taihoku under Japan's empire) and launched the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The WW2 victory allowed the US to expand its line of defense further west to the coast of Asia, and thus the US controlled the first island chain. Between the end of WW2 and the Korean War, MacArthur praised Taiwan, located at the midpoint of the first island chain, as an 'unsinkable aircraft carrier'. 
In April 2014, the United States Naval Institute (USNI) assessed that the first island chain is the most effective point to counter any Chinese invasion. The US could not only cut off the People's Liberation Army Navy from entering the western Pacific, but also predict where they may move before trying to break through in the first place. The US and first island chain countries are able to coordinate because of the US military's freedom of navigation in the first chain block. A June 2019 article published by the United States Naval Institute (USNI) called for the navy to establish and maintain a blockade around the first island chain if the US was go to war with China.
Andrew Krepinevich argued that an ""archipelagic defense"" of the countries that make up the first island chain would make up a big part of the implementation of the national defense strategy of 2018. A 2019 report by the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments ""proposes a U.S. military strategy of Maritime Pressure and a supporting joint operational concept, “Inside-Out” Defense, to stabilize the military balance in the Western Pacific and deny China the prospect of a successful fait accompli."" The first island chain plays a central role in the report. In 2020, the United States Marine Corps started shifting its tactics in conjunction with the United States Navy to be deployed along or near the first island chain. In 2021, the United States Marine Corps announced a goal of three additional Pacific",Islands,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_island_chain,1,first island chain first string major pacific archipelago east asian continental mainland coast principally composed kuril island japanese archipelago ryukyu island taiwan formosa northern philippine borneo hence extending way kamchatka peninsula northeast malay peninsula southwest first island chain form one three island chain doctrine within island chain strategy u foreign policy much first island chain roughly situated water claimed people republic china prc include south china sea within ninedash line well east china sea west okinawa trough strategic value china according united state department defense report congress people liberation army antiaccessarea denial military capability aimed first island chain robust report also stated people liberation army navy ability perform mission beyond first island chain modest growing gain experience operating distant water acquires larger advanced platform japan around japanese military strategist toshi yoshihara naval war college professor james r holmes suggested american military could exploit geography first island chain counter people liberation army navy buildup cabinet japan also passed defense white paper emphasizing threat posed people liberation army navy first island chain later year japan started deploying military asset yonaguni island counter china presence along area first island chain japan strategic position first island chain began usjapan joint effort counter soviet expansion japan selfdefense force currently play role protecting u military base preserving military strength east asia japan territorial protection selfdefense force mainly rely island southern japan adjacent yellow sea east china sea japan military advantage antisubmarine air defense sea mine technology philippine lloyd austin behalf united state thanked counterpart philippine delfin lorenzana retaining yearold visiting force agreement two nation four new base announced philippine taiwan first island chain taiwan considered critical strategic importance located midpoint first chain occupies strategic position united state u general douglas macarthur pointed world war ii u protected western shore line defense hawaii guam philippine however line defense attacked japan pearl harbor bombing thereby drawing u war u subsequently launched air raid taipei called taihoku japan empire launched atomic bombing hiroshima nagasaki ww victory allowed u expand line defense west coast asia thus u controlled first island chain end ww korean war macarthur praised taiwan located midpoint first island chain unsinkable aircraft carrier april united state naval institute usni assessed first island chain effective point counter chinese invasion u could cut people liberation army navy entering western pacific also predict may move trying break first place u first island chain country able coordinate u military freedom navigation first chain block june article published united state naval institute usni called navy establish maintain blockade around first island chain u go war china andrew krepinevich argued archipelagic defense country make first island chain would make big part implementation national defense strategy report center strategic budgetary assessment proposes u military strategy maritime pressure supporting joint operational concept “ insideout ” defense stabilize military balance western pacific deny china prospect successful fait accompli first island chain play central role report united state marine corp started shifting tactic conjunction united state navy deployed along near first island chain united state marine corp announced goal three additional pacific
Astrochemistry,"Astrochemistry is the study of the abundance and reactions of molecules in the universe, and their interaction with radiation. The discipline is an overlap of astronomy and chemistry. The word ""astrochemistry"" may be applied to both the Solar System and the interstellar medium. The study of the abundance of elements and isotope ratios in Solar System objects, such as meteorites, is also called cosmochemistry, while the study of interstellar atoms and molecules and their interaction with radiation is sometimes called molecular astrophysics. The formation, atomic and chemical composition, evolution and fate of molecular gas clouds is of special interest, because it is from these clouds that solar systems form.

History
As an offshoot of the disciplines of astronomy and chemistry, the history of astrochemistry is founded upon the shared history of the two fields. The development of advanced observational and experimental spectroscopy has allowed for the detection of an ever-increasing array of molecules within solar systems and the surrounding interstellar medium. In turn, the increasing number of chemicals discovered by advancements in spectroscopy and other technologies have increased the size and scale of the chemical space available for astrochemical study.

History of spectroscopy
Observations of solar spectra as performed by Athanasius Kircher (1646), Jan Marek Marci (1648), Robert Boyle (1664), and Francesco Maria Grimaldi (1665) all predated Newton's 1666 work which established the spectral nature of light and resulted in the first spectroscope. Spectroscopy was first used as an astronomical technique in 1802 with the experiments of William Hyde Wollaston, who built a spectrometer to observe the spectral lines present within solar radiation. These spectral lines were later quantified through the work of Joseph von Fraunhofer.
Spectroscopy was first used to distinguish between different materials after the release of Charles Wheatstone's 1835 report that the sparks given off by different metals have distinct emission spectra. This observation was later built upon by Léon Foucault, who demonstrated in 1849 that identical absorption and emission lines result from the same material at different temperatures. An equivalent statement was independently postulated by Anders Jonas Ångström in his 1853 work Optiska Undersökningar, where it was theorized that luminous gases emit rays of light at the same frequencies as light which they may absorb.
This spectroscopic data began to take upon theoretical importance with Johann Balmer's observation that the spectral lines exhibited by samples of hydrogen followed a simple empirical relationship which came to be known as the Balmer Series. This series, a special case of the more general Rydberg Formula developed by Johannes Rydberg in 1888, was created to describe the spectral lines observed for hydrogen. Rydberg's work expanded upon this formula by allowing for the calculation of spectral lines for multiple different chemical elements. The theoretical importance granted to these spectroscopic results was greatly expanded upon the development of quantum mechanics, as the theory allowed for these results to be compared to atomic and molecular emission spectra which had been calculated a priori.

While radio astronomy was developed in the 1930s, it was not until 1937 that any substantial evidence arose for the conclusive identification of an interstellar molecule – up until this point, the only chemical species known to exist in interstellar space were atomic. These findings were confirmed in 1940, when McKellar et al. identified and attributed spectroscopic lines in an as-of-then unidentified radio observation to CH and CN molecules in interstellar space. In the thirty years afterwards, a small selection of other molecules were discovered in interstellar space: the most important being OH, discovered in 1963 and significant as a source of interstellar oxygen, and H2CO (formaldehyde), discovered in 1969 and significant for being the first observed organic, polyatomic molecule in interstellar space
The discovery of interstellar formaldehyde – and later, other molecules with potential biological significance, such as water or carbon monoxide – is seen by some as strong supporting evidence for abiogenetic theories of life: specifically, theories which hold that the basic molecular components of life came from extraterrestrial sources. This has prompted a still ongoing search for interstellar molecules which are either of direct biological importance – such as interstellar glycine, discovered in a comet within the Solar System in 2009 – or which exhibit biologically relevant properties like chirality – an example of which (propylene oxide) was discovered in 2016 – alongside more basic astrochemical research.

Ecumenopolis,"Ecumenopolis (from Ancient Greek  οἰκουμένη (oikouménē) 'the inhabited world' and  πόλις (pólis) 'city'; lit. 'world city'; pl. ecumenopolises or ecumenopoleis) is the hypothetical concept of a planetwide city. It is primarily known as a stock setting in science fiction, but has also received serious consideration in theoretical city planning and futurist concepts.

Description
The word was invented in 1967 by the Greek city planner Constantinos Apostolou Doxiadis to represent the idea that, in the future, urban areas and megalopolises would eventually fuse, and there would be a single continuous worldwide city as a progression from the current urbanization, population growth, transport and human networks. According to Doxiadis, it was the fifteenth level of ekistic units and the most significant one as the uppermost echelon of the classification. This concept was already current in science fiction in 1942, with Trantor in Isaac Asimov's Foundation series. When made public, Doxiadis' idea of ecumenopolis seemed ""close to science fiction"", but today is ""surprisingly pertinent"" according to geography researchers Pavle Stamenovic, Dunja Predic and Davor Eres, especially as a consequence of globalization.
Doxiadis also created a scenario based on the traditions and trends of urban development of his time, predicting at first a European eperopolis (""continent city"") which would be based on the area between London, Paris, Rhine-Ruhr and Amsterdam. In 2008, Time magazine coined Nylonkong to link New York City, London, and Hong Kong as the eperopolis of the Americas, Euro-Africa and Asia-Pacific respectively.

In popular culture
Before the term had been created, the concept had been previously discussed. The American religious leader Thomas Lake Harris (1823–1906) mentioned city-planets in his verses, and science fiction author Isaac Asimov used the city-planet Trantor as the setting of some of his Foundation novels.
In science fiction, the ecumenopolis has become a frequent topic and was popularized in 1999 by the fictional city planet Coruscant in the Star Wars franchise, which is the capital of the Galactic Republic (later Empire) and home to the Jedi Order. Other ecumenopolises feature in Star Wars media, including Hosnian Prime, Nar Shaddaa and Taris. 
In Dune, the Harkonnens' home world of Giedi Prime is a heavily polluted ecumenopolis infamous for its gladiator arenas.
The concept is depicted in the video game Stellaris, where players are given the option of transforming planets into ecumenopolises, which provides a great deal of housing and space for industrial production through the construction of arcologies, at the cost of making the planet's natural resources inaccessible.
A central setting in the tabletop wargame Warhammer 40,000 is a portrayal of Earth in the far future, where it is described as having been transformed into a vast, Gothic-style ecumenopolis sometime during the 30th millennium AD after its establishment as the capital of an interstellar superpower known as the Imperium of Man. The ecumenopolis contains multiple continent-scale districts housing different branches of society and government, with the Imperial Palace alone taking up the entirety of the Himalayan Mountains. It is the focus of the ""Siege of Terra"" storyline of the wider Horus Heresy tie-in novel series.
In Magic: the Gathering, the plane of Ravnica is an ecumenopolis.
DC Comics continuity features Darkseid's extra-dimensional home planet of Apokolips, often depicted as a hellish world covered entirely in industrial sprawl to feed Darkseid's brutal empire.
The manga and film of Blame! by Tsutomu Nihei is set in a far future in which Earth has become the ruins of planet-covering city, which is suggested to be so large that it has consumed most of the Solar System as well, it may also be along the lines of a hollow-world or dyson shell. Some of his other works also take place in this same setting.

Crag and tail,"A crag (sometimes spelled cragg, or in Scotland craig) is a rocky hill or mountain, generally isolated from other high ground.

Origin
Crags are formed when a glacier or ice sheet passes over an area that contains a particularly resistant rock formation (often granite, a volcanic plug or some other volcanic structure). The force of the glacier erodes the surrounding softer material, leaving the rocky block protruding from the surrounding terrain. Frequently the crag serves as a partial shelter to softer material in the wake of the glacier, which remains as a gradual fan or ridge forming a tapered ramp (called the tail) up the leeward side of the crag.
In older examples, or those latterly surrounded by the sea, the tail is often missing, having been removed by post-glacial erosion.

Examples
Examples of crag and tail formations include:

Castle Rock (the crag, site of Edinburgh Castle) and the Royal Mile (the tail), in Edinburgh, Scotland
Salisbury Crags and Arthur's Seat, in Edinburgh
North Berwick Law, in North Berwick, Scotland
Three in or near Stirling, Scotland, including the rock on which Stirling Castle stands
""Scrabo Hill"" in Newtownards, Northern Ireland, site of the Scrabo Tower
Ailsa Craig, famous for curling stone mining
Crag and tail features have been identified on the Amundsen Sea continental shelf off West Antarctica.

Biophysical chemistry,"Biophysical chemistry is a physical science that uses the concepts of physics and physical chemistry for the study of biological systems. The most common feature of the research in this subject is to seek an explanation of the various phenomena in biological systems in terms of either the molecules that make up the system or the supra-molecular structure of these systems. Apart from the biological applications, recent research showed progress in the medical field as well.

History
Twentieth Century
Germany
The oldest concept of biophysical chemistry started from the curiosity of Karl Friedrich Bonhoeffer, a physical chemist who wanted to approach biological and physiological problems with knowledge of physics and chemistry. One example of his work is studying the effect of electric current on iron to simulate nerve excitations. After the establishment of fundamental biophysical chemistry in Göttingen, Manfred Eigen, the German Nobel Laureate developed it further. In 1971, he improved the research focus by merging two institutes, physical chemistry, and spectroscopy. Nowadays, the research in biophysical chemistry in Göttingen aims to discover life processes using the combined knowledge of science.

Netherlands
The renowned scientist, Herman Berendsen launched a research group at the University of Groningen focused on using NMR to monitor water and protein in biological systems. The study expands the structural understanding of water bonding which explains a lot of phenomena.

Modern history
Current approaches to biophysical research include but are not limited to the study of ion channels, promoters, stem cells, and the detection and analysis of biomolecules.

Techniques
Biophysical chemists employ various techniques used in physical chemistry to probe the structure of biological systems. These techniques include spectroscopic methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and other techniques like X-ray diffraction and cryo-electron microscopy. An example of research in biophysical chemistry includes the work for which the 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded. The prize was based on X-ray crystallographic studies of the ribosome that helped to unravel the physical basis of its biological function as a molecular machine that translates mRNA into polypeptides. Other areas in which biophysical chemists engage themselves are protein structure and the functional structure of cell membranes. For example, enzyme action can be explained in terms of the shape of a pocket in the protein molecule that matches the shape of the substrate molecule or its modification due to binding of a metal ion. The structures of many large protein assemblies, such as ATP synthase, also exhibit machine-like dynamics as they act on their substrates. Similarly, the structure and function of the biomembranes may be understood through the study of model supramolecular structures as liposomes or phospholipid vesicles of different compositions and sizes.

Applications
There are several biological and medical applications that apply the knowledge of biophysical chemistry to benefit humankind.

Study of Cell Membrane
Lipid bilayer membrane is a name to describe the composition of the cell membrane. With the current knowledge and advancement of the instrument, it is possible to study the properties of lipid bilayers such as viscosity. The study applied the fluorescence spectroscopy technique to identify that even if there is only a single phospholipid bilayer constructs the liposome, we can still detect a different level of viscosity existing in the membrane.

Study of Protein Reactions
Several spectroscopic methods allow modern scientists to identify the kinetic components of protein reactions in biological systems. Moreover, it is possible to adjust and engineer biological reactions by applying laser radiation to them. For instance, we can induce the process of protein crystallization using the technique called ""laser trapping"".

Hydrogel Synthesis
Riboflavin, or commonly, vitamin B2, has the ability to become a reactive species that can undergo various reactions under the existence of light and oxygen. The significant reaction involved the synthesis of a hydrogel. Hydrogel is a porous material that can hold a large amount of water while maintaining its shape. The application of hydrogel includes drug delivery, artificial muscles, tissue engineering, etc.

Enzyme Improvement
Enzymes are substances that can accelerate chemical reactions. However, the usage of enzymes in real applications has a lot of limitations, including, but not limited to stability, compatibility, and cost. By using the concept of biophysical chemistry, it is possible to improve those limitations, as well as increase the performance of enzymes.

Nottingham effect,"In condensed matter physics, the Nottingham effect is a surface cooling and heating mechanism that occurs during field and thermionic electron emission. The effect is named after physicist Wayne B. Nottingham who explained it in a commentary to 1940 experiments by Gertrude M. Fleming and Joseph E. Henderson.
The temperature at which electron emission goes from heating to cooling is called the Nottingham inversion temperature.

Description
Notably, the effect can be either heating or cooling of the surface emitting the electrons, depending upon the energy at which they are supplied. Above the Nottingham inversion temperature, the emission energy exceeds the Fermi energy of the electron supply and the emitted electron carries more energy away from the surface than is returned by the supply of a replacement electron, and the net heat flux from the Nottingham effect switches from heating to cooling the cathode.
Along with Joule heating, the Nottingham effect contributes to the thermal equilibrium of electron emission systems, typically becoming the dominant contributor at very high emission current densities.  It comes into play in the operation of field emission array cathodes and other devices that rely upon stimulating Fowler-Nordheim electron emission, usually at the apex of a sharp tip used to create a field enhancement effect.  In extreme cases, the Nottingham effect can heat the emitter tips to temperatures exceeding the melting point of the tip material, causing the tip to deform and emit material that may cause a vacuum arc; this is a significant failure mode for tip-based cathodes.

Physics of Life,"Physics of life is a branch of physics that studies the fundamental principles governing living systems. It applies methods from mechanics, thermodynamics, statistical physics, and information theory to biological phenomena ranging from molecular assemblies to ecosystems. The field seeks to understand how complex behaviors of life arise from interactions among physical components under conditions far from equilibrium. Biological physics has gained wider recognition as a distinct and essential area within physics research.

Overview
The physics of life investigates how the familiar laws of physics apply to living matter, and how living systems sometimes require new physical principles for their understanding. Rather than viewing biology as an exception, researchers treat biological phenomena as fertile ground for discovering general laws of non-equilibrium matter and information processing.
Biological physics has grown substantially and now constitutes one of the largest divisions of the American Physical Society (APS). It bridges traditional disciplines and introduces concepts such as stochasticity, phase transitions, and self-organization into the study of life.

Conceptual Foundations
A 2022 decadal survey by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine outlined five central questions guiding research in the physics of life:

1. What physics problems do organisms need to solve?
Living systems face physical challenges in energy conversion, locomotion, environmental sensing, and mechanical stability. These problems involve fields such as fluid dynamics, elasticity (physics), and non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

2. How do living systems represent and process information?
Biological systems encode and transmit information through mechanisms like gene regulatory networks, synaptic signaling, and chemical communication. Frameworks such as information theory and Bayesian inference are used to model biological information processing.

3. How do macroscopic functions emerge from microscopic interactions?
Macroscopic properties of tissues, organisms, and ecosystems arise from local physical interactions between molecules, cells, and structures. Research areas include phase separation in cells, collective behavior in animal groups, and morphogenesis.
Scaling relationships often describe the emergent properties of biological systems. For example, diffusion-limited transport obeys a characteristic scaling law:

  
    
      
        R
        ∼
        
          t

              /
            
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle R\sim t^{1/2}}
  

where 
  
    
      
        R

        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
  
, consistent with Brownian motion.
Similarly, phase separation kinetics in living systems are modeled by the Cahn–Hilliard equation:

    {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial \phi }{\partial t}}=\nabla \cdot (M\nabla \mu )}
  

where 
  
    
      
        ϕ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \phi }
  
 is the order parameter, 
  
    
      
        μ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mu }
  
 is the chemical potential, and 
  
    
      
        M
      
    
    {\displaystyle M}
  
 is the mobility. These mathematical models help quantify intracellular compartmentalization, tissue patterning, and early embryonic development.

4. How do living systems navigate parameter space?
Through processes such as evolution, developmental plasticity, and adaptive learning, biological systems explore vast spaces of possible forms and behaviors, optimizing their functions under diverse constraints.

5. How can biological physics inform medicine and technology?
Insights from biological physics have driven advances in biomechanics, neural engineering, synthetic biology, and regenerative medicine.

Experimental and Theoretical Approaches
Experimental tools include optical tweezers, cryo-electron microscopy, and single-molecule tracking. Theoretical approaches combine statistical mechanics, continuum mechanics, machine learning, and non-equilibrium physics.
Concepts such as phase transitions, self-organization, and stochastic fluctuations, traditionally studied in inanimate systems, have become central for understanding biological systems.

Recognition and Growth
Biological physics has evolved from an interdisciplinary curiosity into a central part of modern physics. Researchers emphasize that studying life offers opportunities to discover new organizing principles of matter and information.

Applications of cybernetics in economics,"Economics is one domain in which cybernetics has had application and influence.

In the Soviet Union
The Great Soviet Encyclopaedia defines Economic cybernetics as a scientific field wherein cybernetic approaches are applied to economics. It facilitates a dialogue between microsystems and macrosystems.
The design of self-regulating control systems for a real-time planned economy was explored by economist Oskar Lange, cyberneticist Viktor Glushkov, and other Soviet cyberneticists during the 1960s. By the time information technology was developed enough to enable feasible economic planning based on computers, the Soviet Union and eastern bloc countries began moving away from planning and eventually collapsed.

Project Cybersyn
Hayek
Friedrich Hayek attended the 1960 Symposium on Principles of Self-Organization, organised by Heinz von Foerster.
Hayek mentions cybernetics as a discipline that could help economists understand the ""self-organizing or self-generating systems"" called markets. Being ""complex phenomena"", the best way to examine market functions is by using the feedback mechanism, explained by cybernetic theorists. That way, economists could make ""pattern predictions"".
Therefore, the market for Hayek is a ""communication system"", an ""efficient mechanism for digesting dispersed information"". The economist and a cyberneticist are like gardeners who are ""providing the appropriate environment"". Hayek's definition of information is idiosyncratic and precedes the information theory used in cybernetics and the natural sciences.
Finally, Hayek also considers Adam Smith's idea of the invisible hand as an anticipation of the operation of the feedback mechanism in cybernetics. In the same book, Law, Legislation and Liberty, Hayek mentions, along with cybernetics, that economists should rely on the scientific findings of Ludwig von Bertalanffy general systems theory, along with information and communication theory and semiotics.

Towards a New Socialism
A proposal for a ""New Socialism"" was outlined by the computer scientists Paul Cockshott and Allin Cottrell in 1995 (Towards a New Socialism), where computers determine and manage the flows and allocation of resources among socially owned enterprises.

Direct labor cost,"Direct labor cost is the part of labor cost (payroll costs) that is used directly in the production of goods, performance of a particular work order, or provision of a service.

Determination of the direct labor cost
Direct labor cost may be determined by:

Planning the work to be performed.
Describing the skill requirements of each task.
Matching tasks to employees.
Determining the labor burden per hour and job time required for each task.

Usage
In manufacturing, the direct labor cost is part of the manufacturing cost per item and scales proportionally to the number of items produced. This is in contrast to indirect labor cost, (for example, supervisory staff), which is not directly proportional to manufacturing costs and is considered an overhead expense.

Calculation of direct labor cost
The direct labor cost may be calculated as the product of working time and employee total cost, inclusive of wages and benefits.

  
    
      
        
          Direct labor cost
        
        =
        
          job time
        
        ×
        
          (wage rate + benefits cost)
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\text{Direct labor cost}}={\text{job time}}\times {\text{(wage rate + benefits cost)}}}
  

Depending on the context, labor burden may be calculated on an hourly, daily, or other basis.

Calculating job time
The job time may be measured via one of the following methods:

time study
work sampling
Predetermined motion time system

Freezing level,"The freezing level, or 0 °C (zero-degree) isotherm, represents the altitude in which the temperature is at 0 °C (the freezing point of water) in a free atmosphere (i.e. allowing reflection of the sun by snow, icing conditions, etc.). Any given measure is valid for only a short period of time, often less than a day as variations in wind, sunlight, air masses and other factors may change the level. The 700 hPa pressure level (or about 3000 m above sea level) is generally assumed as a rough estimate of the freezing level.
Above the freezing altitude, the temperature of the air is below freezing. Below it, the temperature is above freezing. The profile of this frontier, and its variations, are studied in meteorology, and are used for a variety of forecasts and predictions, especially in cold weather. Whilst not given on general weather forecasts, it is used on bulletins giving forecasts for mountainous areas.

Measuring
There are several different methods to examine the structure of the temperature of the atmosphere including its freezing level:

A radiosonde attached to a weather balloon is the oldest and most common method used. Each area normally releases two balloons a day in locations hundreds of kilometers apart.
Measuring devices attached to commercial airliners permit reporting the isotherm, and its height from sea level, to aerial traffic.
Weather satellites are equipped with sensors that scan the atmosphere and measure the infrared radiation it emits indicating its temperature.
Weather radar detects bright bands, which are radar echoes produced just underneath and within the isotherm caused by the melting of snow or ice in the layer below that's above 0 °C.
A wind profiler, an upward pointing radar, can detect the speed of precipitation, which is different for rain, snow, slush and melting snow.
Depending on the frequency and resolution at which these readings are taken, these methods can report the isotherm with greater or lesser precision.  Radiosondes, for example, only report a reading twice daily and provide very rough information.  Weather radar can detect a variation every five to ten minutes if there is precipitation, and can scan a radius of up to two kilometers.

Variations in the isotherm
The isotherm can be very stable over a large area.  It varies under two major conditions:

A change in the density of air due to weather fronts. This changes the isotherm gradually, over tens of kilometres for a cold front, and hundreds for a warm front, but the change spreads over a large area.
Local levels can be changed by wind, reflection of the sun, snow, and humidity level. These factors can cause the isotherm to change rapidly and sometimes constantly over several kilometres, in both winter and summer all year round. Also, atmospheric subsidence and ascendence can contribute to variations in the isotherm.
These conditions imply that the 0 °C isotherm varies globally and more so locally.

Economics,"Economics () is a behavioral science that studies the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services.
Economics focuses on the behaviour and interactions of economic agents and how economies work. Microeconomics analyses what is viewed as basic elements within economies, including individual agents and markets, their interactions, and the outcomes of interactions. Individual agents may include, for example, households, firms, buyers, and sellers. Macroeconomics analyses economies as systems where production, distribution, consumption, savings, and investment expenditure interact; and the factors of production affecting them, such as: labour, capital, land, and enterprise, inflation, economic growth, and public policies that impact these elements. It also seeks to analyse and describe the global economy.
Other broad distinctions within economics include those between positive economics, describing ""what is"", and normative economics, advocating ""what ought to be""; between economic theory and applied economics; between rational and behavioural economics; and between mainstream economics and heterodox economics.
Economic analysis can be applied throughout society, including business, finance, cybersecurity, health care, engineering and government. It is also applied to such diverse subjects as crime, education, the family, feminism, law, philosophy, politics, religion, social institutions, war, science, and the environment.

Definitions of economics
The earlier term for the discipline was ""political economy"", but since the late 19th century, it has commonly been called ""economics"". The term is ultimately derived from Ancient Greek οἰκονομία (oikonomia) which is a term for the ""way (nomos) to run a household (oikos)"", or in other words the know-how of an οἰκονομικός (oikonomikos), or ""household or homestead manager"". Derived terms such as ""economy"" can therefore often mean ""frugal"" or ""thrifty"". By extension then, ""political economy"" was the way to manage a polis or state.
There are a variety of modern definitions of economics; some reflect evolving views of the subject or different views among economists. Scottish philosopher Adam Smith (1776) defined what was then called political economy as ""an inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations"", in particular as:

a branch of the science of a statesman or legislator [with the twofold objectives of providing] a plentiful revenue or subsistence for the people ... [and] to supply the state or commonwealth with a revenue for the publick services.
Jean-Baptiste Say (1803), distinguishing the subject matter from its public-policy uses, defined it as the science of production, distribution, and consumption of wealth. On the satirical side, Thomas Carlyle (1849) coined ""the dismal science"" as an epithet for classical economics, in this context, commonly linked to the pessimistic analysis of Malthus (1798). John Stuart Mill (1844) delimited the subject matter further:

The science which traces the laws of such of the phenomena of society as arise from the combined operations of mankind for the production of wealth, in so far as those phenomena are not modified by the pursuit of any other object.
Alfred Marshall provided a still widely cited definition in his textbook Principles of Economics (1890) that extended analysis beyond wealth and from the societal to the microeconomic level:

Economics is a study of man in the ordinary business of life. It enquires how he gets his income and how he uses it. Thus, it is on the one side, the study of wealth and on the other and more important side, a part of the study of man.
Lionel Robbins (1932) developed implications of what has been termed ""[p]erhaps the most commonly accepted current definition of the subject"":

Economics is the science which studies human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.
Robbins described the definition as not classificatory in ""pick[ing] out certain kinds of behaviour"" but rather analytical in ""focus[ing] attention on a particular aspect of behaviour, the form imposed by the influence of scarcity."" He affirmed that previous economists have usually centred their studies on the analysis of wealth: how wealth is created (production), distributed, and consumed; and how wealth can grow. But he said that economics can be used to study other things, such as war, that are outside its usual focus. This is because war has as the goal winning it (as a sought-after end), generates both cost and benefits; and, resources (human life and other costs) are used to attain the goal. If the war is not winnable or if the expected costs outweigh the benefits, the deciding actors (assuming they are rational) may never go to war (a decision) but rather explore other alternatives. Economics cannot be defined as the science that studies wealth, war, crime, education, and any other field economic analysis can be applied to; but, as the science that stu",Economics,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics,0,economics behavioral science study production distribution consumption good service economics focus behaviour interaction economic agent economy work microeconomics analysis viewed basic element within economy including individual agent market interaction outcome interaction individual agent may include example household firm buyer seller macroeconomics analysis economy system production distribution consumption saving investment expenditure interact factor production affecting labour capital land enterprise inflation economic growth public policy impact element also seek analyse describe global economy broad distinction within economics include positive economics describing normative economics advocating ought economic theory applied economics rational behavioural economics mainstream economics heterodox economics economic analysis applied throughout society including business finance cybersecurity health care engineering government also applied diverse subject crime education family feminism law philosophy politics religion social institution war science environment definition economics earlier term discipline political economy since late th century commonly called economics term ultimately derived ancient greek οἰκονομία oikonomia term way nomos run household oikos word knowhow οἰκονομικός oikonomikos household homestead manager derived term economy therefore often mean frugal thrifty extension political economy way manage polis state variety modern definition economics reflect evolving view subject different view among economist scottish philosopher adam smith defined called political economy inquiry nature cause wealth nation particular branch science statesman legislator twofold objective providing plentiful revenue subsistence people supply state commonwealth revenue publick service jeanbaptiste say distinguishing subject matter publicpolicy us defined science production distribution consumption wealth satirical side thomas carlyle coined dismal science epithet classical economics context commonly linked pessimistic analysis malthus john stuart mill delimited subject matter science trace law phenomenon society arise combined operation mankind production wealth far phenomenon modified pursuit object alfred marshall provided still widely cited definition textbook principle economics extended analysis beyond wealth societal microeconomic level economics study man ordinary business life enquires get income us thus one side study wealth important side part study man lionel robbins developed implication termed perhaps commonly accepted current definition subject economics science study human behaviour relationship end scarce mean alternative us robbins described definition classificatory picking certain kind behaviour rather analytical focusing attention particular aspect behaviour form imposed influence scarcity affirmed previous economist usually centred study analysis wealth wealth created production distributed consumed wealth grow said economics used study thing war outside usual focus war goal winning soughtafter end generates cost benefit resource human life cost used attain goal war winnable expected cost outweigh benefit deciding actor assuming rational may never go war decision rather explore alternative economics defined science study wealth war crime education field economic analysis applied science stu
Lake retention time,"Lake retention time (also called the residence time of lake water, or the water age or flushing time) is a calculated quantity expressing the mean time that water (or some dissolved substance) spends in a particular lake. At its simplest, this figure is the result of dividing the lake volume by the flow in or out of the lake. It roughly expresses the amount of time taken for a substance introduced into a lake to flow out of it again. The retention time is particularly important where downstream flooding or pollutants are concerned.

Global retention time
The global retention time for a lake (the overall mean time that water spends in the lake) is calculated by dividing the lake volume by either the mean rate of inflow of all tributaries, or by the mean rate of outflow (ideally including evaporation and seepage). This metric assumes that water in the lake is well-mixed (rather than stratified), so that any portion of the lake water is much like any other. In reality, larger and deeper lakes are generally not well-mixed. Many large lakes can be divided into distinct portions with only limited flow between them. Deep lakes are generally stratified, with deeper water mixing infrequently with surface water. These are often better modeled as several distinct sub-volumes of water.

More specific residence times
It is possible to calculate more specific residence time figures for a particular lake, such as individual residence times for sub-volumes (e.g. particular arms), or a residence time distribution for the various layers of a stratified lake. These figures can often better express the hydrodynamics of the lake. However, any such approach remains a simplification and must be guided by an understanding of the processes operating in the lake.
Two approaches can be used (often in combination) to elucidate how a particular lake works: field measurements and mathematical modeling. One common technique for field measurement is to introduce a tracer into the lake and monitor its movement. This can be a solid tracer, such as a float constructed to be neutrally buoyant within a particular water layer, or sometimes a liquid. This approach is sometimes referred to as using a Lagrangian reference frame. Another field measurement approach, using an Eulerian reference frame, is to capture various properties of the lake water (including mass movement, water temperature, electrical conductivity and levels of dissolved substances, typically oxygen) at various fixed positions in the lake. From these can be constructed an understanding of the dominant processes operating in the various parts of the lake and their range and duration.
Field measurements alone are usually not a reliable basis for generating residence times, mainly because they necessarily represent a small subset of locations and conditions. Therefore, the measurements are generally used as the input for numerical models. In theory it would be possible to integrate a system of hydrodynamic equations with variable boundary conditions over a very long period sufficient for inflowing water particles to exit the lake. One could then calculate the traveling times of the particles using a Lagrangian method. However, this approach exceeds the detail available in current hydrodynamic models and the capacity of current computer resources. Instead, residence time models developed for gas and fluid dynamics, chemical engineering, and bio-hydrodynamics can be adapted to generate residence times for sub-volumes of lakes.

Renewal time
One useful mathematical model is the measurement of how quickly inflows are able to refill a lake.  Renewal time is a specific measure of retention time, where the focus is on 'how long does it take to completely replace all water in a lake.'  This is modeling can only be done with an accurate budget of all water gained and lost by the system.  Renewal time simply becomes a question how quickly could the inflows of the lake fill the entire volume of the basin (this does still assume the outflows are unchanged).  For example if Lake Michigan was emptied, it would take 99 years for its tributaries to completely refill the lake.

20th-century Western painting,"20th-century Western painting begins with the heritage of late-19th-century painters Vincent van Gogh, Paul Cézanne, Paul Gauguin, Georges Seurat, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and others who were essential for the development of modern art. At the beginning of the 20th century, Henri Matisse and several other young artists including the pre-cubist Georges Braque, André Derain, Raoul Dufy and Maurice de Vlaminck, revolutionized the Paris art world with ""wild"", multi-colored, expressive landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called Fauvism. Matisse's second version of The Dance signified a key point in his career and in the development of modern painting. It reflected Matisse's incipient fascination with primitive art: the intense warm color of the figures against the cool blue-green background and the rhythmical succession of the dancing nudes convey the feelings of emotional liberation and hedonism.
Initially influenced by Toulouse-Lautrec, Gauguin, and other late-19th-century innovators, Pablo Picasso made his first cubist paintings based on Cézanne's idea that all depiction of nature can be reduced to three solids: cube, sphere, and cone. With the painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907; see gallery) Picasso created a new and radical picture depicting a raw and primitive brothel scene with five prostitutes, violently painted women, reminiscent of African tribal masks and his own new proto-Cubist inventions. Analytic cubism, exemplified by Violin and Candlestick, Paris, was jointly developed by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque from about 1908 through 1912. Analytic cubism was followed by Synthetic cubism, characterized by the introduction of different textures, surfaces, collage elements, papier collé and a large variety of merged subject matter.
Crystal Cubism was a distilled form of Cubism consistent with a shift between 1915 and 1916 towards a strong emphasis on flat surface activity and large overlapping geometric planes, practised by Braque, Picasso, Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Juan Gris, Diego Rivera, Henri Laurens, Jacques Lipchitz, Alexander Archipenko, Fernand Léger, and several other artists into the 1920s.
During the years between 1910 and the end of World War I and after the heyday of cubism, several movements emerged in Paris. Giorgio de Chirico moved to Paris in July 1911, where he joined his brother Andrea (the poet and painter known as Alberto Savinio). Through his brother he met Pierre Laprade, a member of the jury at the Salon d'Automne, where he exhibited three of his dreamlike works: Enigma of the Oracle, Enigma of an Afternoon and Self-Portrait. During 1913 he exhibited his work at the Salon des Indépendants and Salon d’Automne, where his work was noticed by Pablo Picasso, Guillaume Apollinaire, and others. His compelling and mysterious paintings are considered instrumental to the early beginnings of Surrealism. Song of Love (1914) is one of the most famous works by de Chirico and is an early example of the surrealist style, though it was painted ten years before the movement was ""founded"" by André Breton in 1924.
In the first two decades of the 20th century, as Cubism evolved, several other important movements emerged; Futurism (Giacomo Balla), Abstract art (Wassily Kandinsky), Der Blaue Reiter (Kandinsky and Franz Marc), Bauhaus (Kandinsky and Paul Klee), Orphism, (Robert Delaunay and František Kupka), Synchromism (Morgan Russell and Stanton Macdonald-Wright), De Stijl (Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian), Suprematism (Kazimir Malevich), Constructivism (Vladimir Tatlin), Dadaism (Marcel Duchamp, Picabia and Jean Arp), and Surrealism (Giorgio de Chirico, André Breton, Joan Miró, René Magritte, Salvador Dalí and Max Ernst). Modern painting influenced all the visual arts, from Modernist architecture and design, to avant-garde film, theatre and modern dance, and became an experimental laboratory for the expression of visual experience, from photography and concrete poetry to advertising art and fashion. Van Gogh's paintings exerted great influence upon 20th-century Expressionism, as can be seen in the work of the Fauves, Die Brücke (a group led by German painter Ernst Kirchner), and the Expressionism of Edvard Munch, Egon Schiele, Marc Chagall, Amedeo Modigliani, Chaïm Soutine, and others.

Early 20th century
Pioneers of abstraction
Wassily Kandinsky, a Russian painter, printmaker and art theorist, is generally considered the first important painter of modern abstract art. As an early modernist, in search of new modes of visual expression, and spiritual expression, he theorized—as did contemporary occultists and theosophists—that pure visual abstraction had corollary vibrations with sound and music. They posited that pure abstraction could express pure spirituality. His earliest abstractions were generally titled (as the example in the above gallery) Composition VII, making connection to the work of the composers of music.

North America,"North America is a continent in the Northern and Western hemispheres. North America is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea, and to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean. The region includes Middle America (comprising the Caribbean, Central America, and Mexico) and Northern America.
North America covers an area of about 24,709,000 square kilometers (9,540,000 square miles), representing approximately 16.5% of Earth's land area and 4.8% of its total surface area. It is the third-largest continent by size after Asia and Africa, and the fourth-largest continent by population after Asia, Africa, and Europe. As of 2021, North America's population was estimated as over 592 million people in 23 independent states, or about 7.5% of the world's population. In human geography, the terms ""North America"" and ""North American"" refers to Canada, Greenland, Mexico, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and the United States.
It is unknown with certainty how and when first human populations first reached North America. People were known to live in the Americas at least 20,000 years ago, but various evidence points to possibly earlier dates. The Paleo-Indian period in North America followed the Last Glacial Period, and lasted until about 10,000 years ago when the Archaic period began. The classic stage followed the Archaic period, and lasted from approximately the 6th to 13th centuries. Beginning in 1000 AD, the Norse were the first Europeans to begin exploring and ultimately colonizing areas of North America.
In 1492, the exploratory voyages of Christopher Columbus led to a transatlantic exchange, including migrations of European settlers during the Age of Discovery and the early modern period. Present-day cultural and ethnic patterns reflect interactions between European colonists, indigenous peoples, enslaved Africans, immigrants from Europe, Asia, and descendants of these respective groups.
Europe's colonization in North America led to most North Americans speaking European languages, such as English, Spanish, and French, and the cultures of the region commonly reflect Western traditions. However, relatively small parts of North America in Canada, the United States, Mexico, and Central America have indigenous populations that continue adhering to their respective pre-European colonial cultural and linguistic traditions.

Name
The Americas were named after the Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci by German cartographers Martin Waldseemüller and Matthias Ringmann. Vespucci explored South America between 1497 and 1502, and was the first European to suggest that the Americas represented a landmass then unknown to the Europeans. In 1507, Waldseemüller published a world map, and placed the word ""America"" on the continent of present-day South America. The continent north of present-day Mexico was then referred to as Parias. On a 1553 world map published by Petrus Apianus, North America was called ""Baccalearum"", meaning ""realm of the Cod fish"", in reference to the abundance of cod on the East Coast.
Waldseemüller used the Latinized version of Vespucci's name, Americus Vespucius, in its feminine form of ""America"", following the examples of ""Europa"", ""Asia"", and ""Africa"". Americus originated from Medieval Latin Emericus (see Saint Emeric of Hungary), coming from the Old High German name Emmerich. Map makers later extended the name America to North America.
In 1538, Gerardus Mercator used the term America on his world map of the entire Western Hemisphere. On his subsequent 1569 map, Mercator called North America ""America or New India"" (America sive India Nova).
The Spanish Empire called its territories in North and South America ""Las Indias"", and the name given to the state body that oversaw the region was called the Council of the Indies.

Definition
The United Nations and its statistics division recognize North America as including three subregions: Northern America, Central America, and the Caribbean. ""Northern America"" is a term distinct from ""North America"", excluding the Caribbean and Central America, which also includes Mexico. In the limited context of regional trade agreements, the term is used to reference three countries: Canada, Mexico, and the United States.
France, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Romania, Spain, and the countries of Latin America use a six-continent model, with the Americas viewed as a single continent and North America designating a subregion comprising Canada, Mexico, and Saint Pierre and Miquelon (politically a part of France), the United States, and often Bermuda, Clipperton Island, and Greenland.
North America has historically been known by other names, including Spanish North America, New Spain, New France, British North America and América Septentrional, the first official name given to Mexico.

Hydrosere,"A hydrosere is a plant succession which occurs in an area of fresh water such as in oxbow lakes and kettle lakes. In time, an area of open freshwater will naturally dry out, ultimately becoming woodland. During this change, a range of different landtypes such as swamp and marsh will succeed each other.
The succession from open water to climax woodland takes centuries or millennia. Some intermediate stages will last a shorter time than others. For example, swamp may change to marsh within a decade or less. How long it takes will depend largely on the amount of siltation occurring in the area of open water.

Stages
Hydrosere is the primary succession sequence which develops in aquatic environments such as lakes and ponds. It results in conversion of water body and its community into a land community. The early changes are allogenic as inorganic particles such as sand and clay are washed from catchment areas and begin filling the basin of the water body. Later, remains of dead plants also fill up these bodies and contribute to further changes in the environment.
If a water body is large and very deep, a strong wave action is at work, therefore in these bodies a noticeable change cannot easily be observed. However, in smaller water bodies such as a pond the succession is easily recognizable. Different plant communities occupy different zones in a water body and exhibit concentric zonation. The edges of the water body are occupied by rooted species, submerged species are found in the littoral zone and plankton and floating species occupy the open water zone.
There is nevertheless still debate about whether dry woodland is always the final climax community, or whether a watery, bog community can also be the final, stable, climax community.

Phytoplankton stage
Phytoplanktons (cyanobacteria), green algae (Spirogyra, Oedogonium), diatoms, etc. are the pioneer colonizers in the initial stage, starting from a water body, such as a pond. Their spores are carried by air to the pond. The phytoplankton are followed by zooplankton. They settle down to the bottom of the pond after death, and decay into humus that mixes with silt and clay particles brought into the basin by run off water and wave action and form soil. As soil builds up, the pond becomes shallower and further environmental changes follow.

Submerged stage
As the water body becomes shallower, more submerged rooted species are able to become established due to increasing light penetration in the shallower water. This is suitable for growth of rooted submerged species such as Myriophyllum, Vallisneria, Elodea, Hydrilla, and Ceratophyllum. These plants root themselves in mud. Once submerged species colonize the successional changes are more rapid and are mainly autogenic as organic matter accumulates. Inorganic sediment is still entering the lake and is trapped more quickly by the net of plant roots and rhizomes growing on the pond floor. The pond becomes sufficiently shallow (2–5 ft) for floating species and less suitable for rooted submerged plants.

Floating stage
The floating plants are rooted in the mud, but some or all their leaves float on the surface of the water. These include species like Nymphaea, Nelumbo and Potamogeton. Some free-floating species also become associated with root plants. The large and broad leaves of floating plants shade the water surface and conditions become unsuitable for growth of submerged species which start disappearing. The plants decay to form organic mud which makes the pond more shallow yet (1–3 ft).

Reed swamp stage
The pond is now invaded by emergent plants such as Phragmites (reed-grasses), Typha (cattail), and Zizania (wild rice) to form a reed-swamp (in North American usage, this habitat is called a marsh).  These plants have creeping rhizomes which knit the mud together to produce large quantities of leaf litter. This litter is resistant to decay and reed peat builds up, accelerating the autogenic change. The surface of the pond is converted into water-saturated marshy land.

Sedge-meadow stage
Successive decreases in water level and changes in substratum help members of Cyperaceae and Graminae such as Carex spp. and Juncus to establish themselves. They form a mat of vegetation extending towards the centre of the pond. Their rhizomes knit the soil further. The above water leaves transpire water to lower the water level further and add additional leaf litter to the soil. Eventually the sedge peat accumulates above the water level and soil is no longer totally waterlogged. The habitat becomes suitable for invasion of herbs (secondary species) such as Mentha, Caltha, Iris, and Galium which grow luxuriantly and bring further changes to the environment. Mesic conditions develop and marshy vegetation begins to disappear.

Woodland stage
The soil now remains drier for most of the year and becomes suitable for development of wet woodland. It is invaded by shrubs and trees such as Salix (willow), Alnus (alder), and Populus ",Lakes,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrosere,1,hydrosere plant succession occurs area fresh water oxbow lake kettle lake time area open freshwater naturally dry ultimately becoming woodland change range different landtypes swamp marsh succeed succession open water climax woodland take century millennium intermediate stage last shorter time others example swamp may change marsh within decade less long take depend largely amount siltation occurring area open water stage hydrosere primary succession sequence develops aquatic environment lake pond result conversion water body community land community early change allogenic inorganic particle sand clay washed catchment area begin filling basin water body later remains dead plant also fill body contribute change environment water body large deep strong wave action work therefore body noticeable change easily observed however smaller water body pond succession easily recognizable different plant community occupy different zone water body exhibit concentric zonation edge water body occupied rooted specie submerged specie found littoral zone plankton floating specie occupy open water zone nevertheless still debate whether dry woodland always final climax community whether watery bog community also final stable climax community phytoplankton stage phytoplankton cyanobacteria green algae spirogyra oedogonium diatom etc pioneer colonizer initial stage starting water body pond spore carried air pond phytoplankton followed zooplankton settle bottom pond death decay humus mix silt clay particle brought basin run water wave action form soil soil build pond becomes shallower environmental change follow submerged stage water body becomes shallower submerged rooted specie able become established due increasing light penetration shallower water suitable growth rooted submerged specie myriophyllum vallisneria elodea hydrilla ceratophyllum plant root mud submerged specie colonize successional change rapid mainly autogenic organic matter accumulates inorganic sediment still entering lake trapped quickly net plant root rhizome growing pond floor pond becomes sufficiently shallow – ft floating specie less suitable rooted submerged plant floating stage floating plant rooted mud leaf float surface water include specie like nymphaea nelumbo potamogeton freefloating specie also become associated root plant large broad leaf floating plant shade water surface condition become unsuitable growth submerged specie start disappearing plant decay form organic mud make pond shallow yet – ft reed swamp stage pond invaded emergent plant phragmites reedgrasses typha cattail zizania wild rice form reedswamp north american usage habitat called marsh plant creeping rhizome knit mud together produce large quantity leaf litter litter resistant decay reed peat build accelerating autogenic change surface pond converted watersaturated marshy land sedgemeadow stage successive decrease water level change substratum help member cyperaceae graminae carex spp juncus establish form mat vegetation extending towards centre pond rhizome knit soil water leaf transpire water lower water level add additional leaf litter soil eventually sedge peat accumulates water level soil longer totally waterlogged habitat becomes suitable invasion herb secondary specie mentha caltha iris galium grow luxuriantly bring change environment mesic condition develop marshy vegetation begin disappear woodland stage soil remains drier year becomes suitable development wet woodland invaded shrub tree salix willow alnus alder populus
Chemical library,"A chemical library or compound library is a collection of stored chemicals usually used ultimately in high-throughput screening or industrial manufacture. The chemical library can consist in simple terms of a series of stored chemicals. Each chemical has associated information stored in some kind of database with information such as the chemical structure, purity, quantity, and physiochemical characteristics of the compound.

Purpose
In drug discovery high-throughput screening, it is desirable to screen a drug target against a selection of chemicals that try to take advantage of as much of the appropriate chemical space as possible. The chemical space of all possible chemical structures is extraordinarily large. Most stored chemical libraries do not typically have a fully represented or sampled chemical space mostly because of storage and cost concerns. However, since many molecular interactions cannot be predicted, the wider the chemical space that is sampled by the chemical library, the better the chance that high-throughput screening will find a ""hit""—a chemical with an appropriate interaction in a biological model that might be developed into a drug.
An example of a chemical library in drug discovery would be a series of chemicals known to inhibit kinases, or in industrial processes, a series of catalysts known to polymerize resins.

Generation of chemical libraries
Chemical libraries are usually generated for a specific goal and larger chemical libraries could be made of several groups of smaller libraries stored in the same location.  In the drug discovery process for instance, a wide range of organic chemicals are needed to test against models of disease in high-throughput screening. Therefore, most of the chemical synthesis needed to generate chemical libraries in drug discovery is based on organic chemistry. A company that is interested in screening for kinase inhibitors in cancer may limit their chemical libraries and synthesis to just those types of chemicals known to have affinity for ATP binding sites or allosteric sites.
Generally, however, most chemical libraries focus on large groups of varied organic chemical series where an organic chemist can make many variations on the same molecular scaffold or molecular backbone. Sometimes chemicals can be purchased from outside vendors as well and included into an internal chemical library.
Depending upon their scope and design, chemical libraries can also be classified as diverse oriented, Drug-like, Lead-like, peptide-mimetic, Natural Product-like, Targeted against a specific family of biological targets such Kinases, GPCRs, Proteases, PPI etc. These chemical libraries are often used in target based drug discovery (reverse pharmacology). Among the compound libraries should be annotated the Fragment Compound Libraries, which are mainly used for Fragment-based lead discovery.

Design and optimization of chemical libraries
Chemical libraries are usually designed by chemists and chemoinformatics scientists and synthesized by organic chemistry and medicinal chemistry. The method of chemical library generation usually depends on the project and there are many factors to consider when using rational methods to select screening compounds. Typically, a range of chemicals is screened against a particular drug target or disease model, and the preliminary ""hits"", or chemicals that show the desired activity, are re-screened to verify their activity. Once they are qualified as a ""hit"" by their repeatability and activity, these particular chemicals are registered and analysed. Chemoproteomics is a field of study that incorporates the use of chemical libraries to identify protein targets. Commonalities among the different chemical groups are studied as they are often reflective of a particular chemical subspace. Additional chemistry work may be needed to further optimize the chemical library in the active portion of the subspace. When it is needed, more synthesis is completed to extend out the chemical library in that particular subspace by generating more compounds that are very similar to the original hits. This new selection of compounds within this narrow range are further screened and then taken on to more sophisticated models for further validation in the Drug Discovery Hit to Lead process.

Storage and management
The ""chemical space"" of all possible organic chemicals is large and increases exponentially with the size of the molecule. Most chemical libraries do not typically have a fully represented chemical space mostly because of storage and cost concerns.
Because of the expense and effort involved in chemical synthesis, the chemicals must be correctly stored and banked away for later use to prevent early degradation. Each chemical has a particular shelf life and storage requirement and in a good-sized chemical library, there is a timetable by which library chemicals are disposed of and replaced on a regular basis.

Coastal hydrogeology,"Coastal Hydrogeology is a branch of Hydrogeology that focuses on the movement and the chemical properties of groundwater in coastal areas. Coastal Hydrogeology studies the interaction between fresh groundwater and seawater, including seawater intrusion, sea level induced groundwater level fluctuation, submarine groundwater discharge, human activities and groundwater management in coastal areas.
The freshwater-seawater interface is a dynamic boundary where freshwater mixes with seawater. An interface in Coastal Hydrogeology refers to the location that freshwater from aquifer meets seawater. Steady freshwater-seawater interface is an equilibrium stage where the boundary locates in a relatively fixed location, while seawater intrusion or a strong recharge rate breaks the equilibrium, leading to an unsteady freshwater-seawater interface. Mixing of groundwater and seawater creates a special chemical system that is a good indicator to show the interaction and the interface.
Human activities such as pumping of groundwater and land reclamation break the equilibrium, leading to seawater intrusion, development of a seepage zone or pollution of the ocean. The interaction between groundwater system and the ocean is complex. Preventive actions and engineering measurements are adopted to mitigate the impacts.

Freshwater-Seawater Interface
Freshwater – Seawater interface or saltwater interface is an essential aspect in Coastal Hydrogeology that tries to figure out the location of the transition zone or mixing zone between freshwater and seawater. A sharp interface is formed when the transition zone is thin or narrow. Coastal aquifers can be classified in the same three categories as all aquifer systems: Sedimentary Aquifers, Hard Rock Aquifers and Limestone Aquifers.

Ghijben – Herzberg Principle
The Ghijben – Herzberg Principle formulated the water table and the boundary of groundwater in an island or unconfined aquifer should form a lens-shape. This principle can estimate the bottom boundary of the interface which provides a general idea of the capacity of an aquifer. By estimating the capacity of an aquifer, we can find out the available groundwater resource in some regions.

Freshwater-Seawater Interface in Coastal Aquifers
It is assumed that the aquifers below are homogeneous in the different models so that the hydraulic conductivity of each aquifer is uniform.

The above figures simulate possible coastal aquifers. In reality, it is complex. Due to complex geology - non-uniform rock layers and weathering, both confined and unconfined aquifers can be found within a coast. It is possible to have multiple confined aquifers at the bottom and an unconfined aquifers at the top of a coast.

Seawater Intrusion
Seawater intrusion is a process where seawater intrudes into a freshwater aquifer. Natural or anthropogenic factors can cause seawater intrusion. Salinization of a freshwater aquifer can be caused by the inflow of seawater due to a change in groundwater pressure, reduction in water recharge, reduction in groundwater discharge, or other sources of salt entering the aquifer. The transition zone or the interface would shift either to the land or shift vertically. Sea level rise, flooding or tsunami also leads to saltwater intrusion into the freshwater aquifer.

Pumping-Induced Saltwater Up-coning
Pumping of groundwater from a well near the interface could cause seawater up-coning where seawater intrudes vertically to the aquifer. When the pumping rate exceeds the maximum pumping rate or critical pumping rate, seawater would be pumped out.

Effects of Heterogeneity and Anisotropy
Aquifers should be anisotropic and heterogeneous. A high permeability layer is associated with the freshwater flow. If the hydraulic conductivity of an aquifer in a vertical direction is lower than the horizontal direction, the transition zone would shift more in a horizontal direction.

Tides
Tides can push the transition zone towards the land and widen the transition zone. Tides can strengthen the freshwater seawater mixing due to dampening of the tidal pressure forming the non-uniform flow of groundwater. The greater the tidal amplitude, the greater the mixing effect. Less dampening in an aquifer would lead to a more uniform flow.

Other factors
Geological structures that cross-cut different layers such as faults or dykes can affect the direction and velocity of seawater intrusion.  Dykes, an igneous unit that is impermeable or low in hydraulic conductivity might stop the intrusion of seawater. Faults also affect the direction of water flow which is studied by Fault Zone Hydrogeology. Both regular and catastrophic flooding can cause downward intrusion of seawater recreating the transition zone of the fresh-salt water. Diffusion would also be responsible for seawater intrusion, as there is a net flow of solutes from high concentration to low concentration. For example, a complete salinization of a 10 m thick layer of freshwater takes thousands ",Oceans,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastal_hydrogeology,1,coastal hydrogeology branch hydrogeology focus movement chemical property groundwater coastal area coastal hydrogeology study interaction fresh groundwater seawater including seawater intrusion sea level induced groundwater level fluctuation submarine groundwater discharge human activity groundwater management coastal area freshwaterseawater interface dynamic boundary freshwater mix seawater interface coastal hydrogeology refers location freshwater aquifer meet seawater steady freshwaterseawater interface equilibrium stage boundary locates relatively fixed location seawater intrusion strong recharge rate break equilibrium leading unsteady freshwaterseawater interface mixing groundwater seawater creates special chemical system good indicator show interaction interface human activity pumping groundwater land reclamation break equilibrium leading seawater intrusion development seepage zone pollution ocean interaction groundwater system ocean complex preventive action engineering measurement adopted mitigate impact freshwaterseawater interface freshwater – seawater interface saltwater interface essential aspect coastal hydrogeology try figure location transition zone mixing zone freshwater seawater sharp interface formed transition zone thin narrow coastal aquifer classified three category aquifer system sedimentary aquifer hard rock aquifer limestone aquifer ghijben – herzberg principle ghijben – herzberg principle formulated water table boundary groundwater island unconfined aquifer form lensshape principle estimate bottom boundary interface provides general idea capacity aquifer estimating capacity aquifer find available groundwater resource region freshwaterseawater interface coastal aquifer assumed aquifer homogeneous different model hydraulic conductivity aquifer uniform figure simulate possible coastal aquifer reality complex due complex geology nonuniform rock layer weathering confined unconfined aquifer found within coast possible multiple confined aquifer bottom unconfined aquifer top coast seawater intrusion seawater intrusion process seawater intrudes freshwater aquifer natural anthropogenic factor cause seawater intrusion salinization freshwater aquifer caused inflow seawater due change groundwater pressure reduction water recharge reduction groundwater discharge source salt entering aquifer transition zone interface would shift either land shift vertically sea level rise flooding tsunami also lead saltwater intrusion freshwater aquifer pumpinginduced saltwater upconing pumping groundwater well near interface could cause seawater upconing seawater intrudes vertically aquifer pumping rate exceeds maximum pumping rate critical pumping rate seawater would pumped effect heterogeneity anisotropy aquifer anisotropic heterogeneous high permeability layer associated freshwater flow hydraulic conductivity aquifer vertical direction lower horizontal direction transition zone would shift horizontal direction tide tide push transition zone towards land widen transition zone tide strengthen freshwater seawater mixing due dampening tidal pressure forming nonuniform flow groundwater greater tidal amplitude greater mixing effect less dampening aquifer would lead uniform flow factor geological structure crosscut different layer fault dyke affect direction velocity seawater intrusion dyke igneous unit impermeable low hydraulic conductivity might stop intrusion seawater fault also affect direction water flow studied fault zone hydrogeology regular catastrophic flooding cause downward intrusion seawater recreating transition zone freshsalt water diffusion would also responsible seawater intrusion net flow solute high concentration low concentration example complete salinization thick layer freshwater take thousand
Island syndrome,"Island syndrome describes the differences in morphology, ecology, physiology and behaviour of insular species compared to their continental counterparts. These differences evolve due to the different ecological pressures affecting insular species, including a paucity of large predators and herbivores as well as a consistently mild climate.

Ecological driving factors
Reduced predation. Island ecosystems cannot support a sufficient biomass of prey in order to accommodate large predators. This largely relieves prey species of the risk of predation, which mostly removes the selection pressure for morphologies, ecologies and behaviours that help to evade large predators.
Reduced biodiversity. Insular ecosystems tend to comprise large populations of a limited number of species (a state termed density compensation), therefore, they exhibit low biodiversity. This results in reduced interspecific competition and increased intraspecific competition.
Reduced sexual selection. There is also reduced sexual selection in insular species, which is especially prominent in birds which lose their sexually dimorphic plumage used in sexual displays.
Reduced parasite diversity. Finally, there is reduced parasite diversity in insular ecosystems which reduces the level of selection acting on immune-related genes.

Features of island syndrome in animals
Body size
Interspecific competition between continental species drives divergence of body size so that species may avoid high levels of competition by occupying distinct niches. Reduced interspecific competition between insular species reduces this selection pressure for species to occupy distinct niches. As a result, there is less diversity in the body size of insular species. Typically small mammals increase in size (for example fossa are a larger insular relative of the mongoose) while typically large mammals decrease in size (for example the Malagasy hippopotamuses are smaller insular relatives of continental hippopotamuses). These are examples of insular gigantism and insular dwarfism respectively. This observed effect is called Foster's rule. Conversely, birds and reptiles tend to exhibit insular gigantism, exemplified by the moa, cassowary and Komodo dragon.
Although the giant tortoises of the Galápagos Islands and the Seychelles (the Galápagos tortoise and Aldabrachelys respectively) are sometimes given as examples of insular gigantism, they are now thought to represent the last remaining populations of historically widespread giant tortoises. The remains of tortoises of similar or larger size have been found in Australia (Meiolania), southern Asia (Megalochelys), Madagascar (Aldabrachelys), North America (Hesperotestudo) and South America (Chelonoidis). The extant giant tortoises are thought to persist only in a few remote archipelagos because humans arrived there relatively late and have not heavily predated them, suggesting that these tortoise populations have been less subjected to overexploitation.

Locomotion
Since insular prey species experience a reduced risk of predation, they often lose or reduce morphologies utilised in predator evasion. For example, the wings of  weevils, rails and pigeons have become so reduced in insular species that many have lost the ability to fly. This has occurred in  several ratites including the kiwi and the cassowary as well as in the dodo and the kākāpō after invading island habitats. The extinct moa of New Zealand exhibit the most extreme known example of insular wing reduction; there is no osseous evidence of even vestigial wings and the pectoral girdle is reduced to a scapulocoracoideum which would be unable to bear a forelimb as it lacks a glenoid fossa. Therefore, it is the only bird known to have completely lost its wings after a shift to insularity. Loss of flight allows birds to eliminate the costs of maintaining large flight-enabling muscles like the pectoral muscles and allows the skeleton to become heavier and stronger. Insular populations of barn owl have shorter wings, representing a transitional stage in which their capacity for flight is being reduced.

Adaptive coloration
Due to the reduced sexual selection of insular species, they tend to exhibit reduced sexual coloration so as to conserve the energy that this demands. Additionally, the low biodiversity of insular ecosystems makes species recognition less important so species-specific coloration is under less selection. As a result, insular bird species often exhibit duller, sexually monomorphic plumage.
Several insular species acquire increased melanin colouration. Male white-winged fairywrens living on mainland Australia exhibit a blue nuptial plumage, whereas two island subspecies (Malurus leucopterus leucopterus from Dirk Hartog Island and Malurus leucopterus edouardi from Barrow Island) exhibit a black nuptial plumage. A subspecies of the chestnut-bellied monarch endemic to the Solomon Islands, Monarcha castaneiventris obscurior, exhibits polymorphism in plumage ",Islands,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_syndrome,1,island syndrome describes difference morphology ecology physiology behaviour insular specie compared continental counterpart difference evolve due different ecological pressure affecting insular specie including paucity large predator herbivore well consistently mild climate ecological driving factor reduced predation island ecosystem support sufficient biomass prey order accommodate large predator largely relief prey specie risk predation mostly remove selection pressure morphology ecology behaviour help evade large predator reduced biodiversity insular ecosystem tend comprise large population limited number specie state termed density compensation therefore exhibit low biodiversity result reduced interspecific competition increased intraspecific competition reduced sexual selection also reduced sexual selection insular specie especially prominent bird lose sexually dimorphic plumage used sexual display reduced parasite diversity finally reduced parasite diversity insular ecosystem reduces level selection acting immunerelated gene feature island syndrome animal body size interspecific competition continental specie drive divergence body size specie may avoid high level competition occupying distinct niche reduced interspecific competition insular specie reduces selection pressure specie occupy distinct niche result less diversity body size insular specie typically small mammal increase size example fossa larger insular relative mongoose typically large mammal decrease size example malagasy hippopotamus smaller insular relative continental hippopotamus example insular gigantism insular dwarfism respectively observed effect called foster rule conversely bird reptile tend exhibit insular gigantism exemplified moa cassowary komodo dragon although giant tortoise galápagos island seychelles galápagos tortoise aldabrachelys respectively sometimes given example insular gigantism thought represent last remaining population historically widespread giant tortoise remains tortoise similar larger size found australia meiolania southern asia megalochelys madagascar aldabrachelys north america hesperotestudo south america chelonoidis extant giant tortoise thought persist remote archipelago human arrived relatively late heavily predated suggesting tortoise population less subjected overexploitation locomotion since insular prey specie experience reduced risk predation often lose reduce morphology utilised predator evasion example wing weevil rail pigeon become reduced insular specie many lost ability fly occurred several ratite including kiwi cassowary well dodo kākāpō invading island habitat extinct moa new zealand exhibit extreme known example insular wing reduction osseous evidence even vestigial wing pectoral girdle reduced scapulocoracoideum would unable bear forelimb lack glenoid fossa therefore bird known completely lost wing shift insularity loss flight allows bird eliminate cost maintaining large flightenabling muscle like pectoral muscle allows skeleton become heavier stronger insular population barn owl shorter wing representing transitional stage capacity flight reduced adaptive coloration due reduced sexual selection insular specie tend exhibit reduced sexual coloration conserve energy demand additionally low biodiversity insular ecosystem make specie recognition less important speciesspecific coloration less selection result insular bird specie often exhibit duller sexually monomorphic plumage several insular specie acquire increased melanin colouration male whitewinged fairywrens living mainland australia exhibit blue nuptial plumage whereas two island subspecies malurus leucopterus leucopterus dirk hartog island malurus leucopterus edouardi barrow island exhibit black nuptial plumage subspecies chestnutbellied monarch endemic solomon island monarcha castaneiventris obscurior exhibit polymorphism plumage
Animal-made art,"Animal-made art consists of works by non-human animals, that have been considered by humans to be artistic, including visual works, music, photography, and videography. Some of these are created naturally by animals, often as courtship displays, while others are created with human involvement.
There have been debates about the copyright status of these works, with the United States Copyright Office stating in 2014 that works that lack human authorship cannot have their copyright registered at the US Copyright Office.

Painting
Donkey
A painting partially made by Lolo the donkey, Et le soleil s'endormit sur l'Adriatique (Sunset Over the Adriatic) was exhibited at the 1910 Salon des Indépendants attributed to the 'excessivist' Genoan painter Joachim-Raphaël Boronali, an invention of writer and critic Roland Dorgelès, who painted much of the painting. It sold for 400 francs and was donated by Dorgelès to the Orphelinat des Arts. The painting forms part of the permanent collection at l'Espace culturel Paul Bédu (Milly-la-Forêt).

Primates
During the late 1950s biologists began to study the nature of art in humans. Theories were proposed based on observations of non-human primate paintings. Hundreds of such paintings were cataloged by Desmond Morris. Morris and his associate Tyler Harris interpreted these canvas paintings as indications of an intrinsic motivation toward abstract creativity, as expressed through an exploration of the visual field and color. Many of these painters progressed over time by expanding or contracting the area of paint coverage, the horizontal or vertical stroke relationships, and even the development of content. Such paintings were exhibited in many modern art museums during the late 1950s and early 1960s. The cultural and scientific interest in these paintings diminished steadily and little note is taken today.
The most successful chimpanzee artist is Congo (1954–1964). Morris offered him a pencil and paper at two years of age, and by the age of four, Congo had made 400 drawings and paintings. His style has been described as ""lyrical abstract impressionism"". Media reaction to Congo's painting abilities were mixed, although relatively positive and accepted with interest. Pablo Picasso was reportedly a ""fan"" of his paintings, and hung one in his studio after receiving it as a gift. In 2005 Congo's paintings were included in an auction at Bonhams alongside works by Renoir and Warhol. They sold for more than expected, while Renoir's and Warhol's did not sell. American collector Howard Hong purchased three of Congo's works for over US$25,000.
A more recent example is Pockets Warhol, a capuchin monkey from the Story Book Farm Primate sanctuary, who has been painting since 2011.

Elephants
Elephants in captivity have been trained to paint as a form of zoo environmental and behavioral enrichment. This includes Ruby the elephant, who lived most of her life at the Phoenix Zoo and produced abstract paintings. 
Another example of this is seen at Melbourne Zoo. However, research published in 2014 indicated that elephants gain little enrichment from the activity of painting apart from the positive reinforcement given by zookeepers during the activity.  The scientists concluded that the ""benefits of this activity appear to be limited to the aesthetic appeal of these paintings to the people viewing them"". The elephants draw the same painting each time and have learned to draw it line-for-line.  
In Thailand, several elephant centers exhibit painting elephants. A zoologist who visited one such elephant show concluded that the elephants were being instructed by their trainers on the directions of their brushstrokes through tugs on their ear. It has been alleged that cruelty is involved in some tourist destinations where elephants are trained to paint.

Dolphins
In some dolphin shows, educated dolphins and beluga whales paint with brushes. The Institute for Marine Mammal Studies has taught several of its dolphins to paint.

Rabbit
Bini the Bunny (born 2012) is a Holland lop rabbit who paints abstract art on small canvases, holding a brush in his mouth. His paintings are featured on a YouTube channel.

Pig
Pigcasso (2016–2024) was a South African pig who gained international notoriety for her abstract expressionist paintings, which have sold for thousands of dollars around the world. Pigcasso was rescued from an industrial hog farm as a piglet by her owner, Joanne Lefson, who taught her to paint using positive reinforcement techniques. Lefson used the proceeds of the sales of Pigcasso's paintings to raise funds for her farm sanctuary in Franschhoek, South Africa.
Each of Pigcasso's works was signed by means of the artist dipping her nose-tip into beetroot ink and touching it onto the canvas.
Pigcasso and Lefson are the first non-human/human collaboration to have held an art exhibition together, which took place at the Victoria & Alfred Waterfront in Cape Town in 2018.

Chemical element,"A chemical element is a chemical substance whose atoms all have the same number of protons. The number of protons is called the atomic number of that element. For example, oxygen has an atomic number of 8: each oxygen atom has 8 protons in its nucleus. Atoms of the same element can have different numbers of neutrons in their nuclei, known as isotopes of the element. Two or more atoms can combine to form molecules. Some elements form molecules of atoms of said element only: e.g. atoms of hydrogen (H) form diatomic molecules (H2). Chemical compounds are substances made of atoms of different elements; they can have molecular or non-molecular structure. Mixtures are materials containing different chemical substances; that means (in case of molecular substances) that they contain different types of molecules. Atoms of one element can be transformed into atoms of a different element in nuclear reactions, which change an atom's atomic number.
Historically, the term ""chemical element"" meant a substance that cannot be broken down into constituent substances by chemical reactions, and for most practical purposes this definition still has validity. There was some controversy in the 1920s over whether isotopes deserved to be recognised as separate elements if they could be separated by chemical means.
The term ""(chemical) element"" is used in two different but closely related meanings: it can mean a chemical substance consisting of a single kind of atom (a free element), or it can mean that kind of atom as a component of various chemical substances. For example, water (H2O) consists of the elements hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O) even though it does not contain the chemical substances (di)hydrogen (H2) and (di)oxygen (O2), as H2O molecules are different from H2 and O2 molecules. For the meaning ""chemical substance consisting of a single kind of atom"", the terms ""elementary substance"" and ""simple substance"" have been suggested, but they have not gained much acceptance in English chemical literature, whereas in some other languages their equivalent is widely used. For example, French distinguishes élément chimique (kind of atoms) and corps simple (chemical substance consisting of one kind of atom); Russian distinguishes химический элемент and простое вещество.
Almost all baryonic matter in the universe is composed of elements (among rare exceptions are neutron stars). When different elements undergo chemical reactions, atoms are rearranged into new compounds held together by chemical bonds. Only a few elements, such as silver and gold, are found uncombined as relatively pure native element minerals. Nearly all other naturally occurring elements occur in the Earth as compounds or mixtures. Air is mostly a mixture of molecular nitrogen and oxygen, though it does contain compounds including carbon dioxide and water, as well as atomic argon, a noble gas which is chemically inert and therefore does not undergo chemical reactions.
The history of the discovery and use of elements began with early human societies that discovered native minerals like carbon, sulfur, copper and gold (though the modern concept of an element was not yet understood). Attempts to classify materials such as these resulted in the concepts of classical elements, alchemy, and similar theories throughout history. Much of the modern understanding of elements developed from the work of Dmitri Mendeleev, a Russian chemist who published the first recognizable periodic table in 1869. This table organizes the elements by increasing atomic number into rows (""periods"") in which the columns (""groups"") share recurring (""periodic"") physical and chemical properties. The periodic table summarizes various properties of the elements, allowing chemists to derive relationships between them and to make predictions about elements not yet discovered, and potential new compounds.
By November 2016, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) recognized a total of 118 elements. The first 94 occur naturally on Earth, and the remaining 24 are synthetic elements produced in nuclear reactions. Save for unstable radioactive elements (radioelements) which decay quickly, nearly all elements are available industrially in varying amounts. The discovery and synthesis of further new elements is an ongoing area of scientific study.

Description
The lightest elements are hydrogen and helium, both created by Big Bang nucleosynthesis in the first 20 minutes of the universe in a ratio of around 3:1 by mass (or 12:1 by number of atoms), along with tiny traces of the next two elements, lithium and beryllium. Almost all other elements found in nature were made by various natural methods of nucleosynthesis. On Earth, small amounts of new atoms are naturally produced in nucleogenic reactions, or in cosmogenic processes, such as cosmic ray spallation. New atoms are also naturally produced on Earth as radiogenic daughter isotopes of ongoing radioactive decay processes such as alpha decay,",Chemistry,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element,0,chemical element chemical substance whose atom number proton number proton called atomic number element example oxygen atomic number oxygen atom proton nucleus atom element different number neutron nucleus known isotope element two atom combine form molecule element form molecule atom said element eg atom hydrogen h form diatomic molecule h chemical compound substance made atom different element molecular nonmolecular structure mixture material containing different chemical substance mean case molecular substance contain different type molecule atom one element transformed atom different element nuclear reaction change atom atomic number historically term chemical element meant substance broken constituent substance chemical reaction practical purpose definition still validity controversy whether isotope deserved recognised separate element could separated chemical mean term chemical element used two different closely related meaning mean chemical substance consisting single kind atom free element mean kind atom component various chemical substance example water ho consists element hydrogen h oxygen even though contain chemical substance dihydrogen h dioxygen ho molecule different h molecule meaning chemical substance consisting single kind atom term elementary substance simple substance suggested gained much acceptance english chemical literature whereas language equivalent widely used example french distinguishes élément chimique kind atom corp simple chemical substance consisting one kind atom russian distinguishes химический элемент простое вещество almost baryonic matter universe composed element among rare exception neutron star different element undergo chemical reaction atom rearranged new compound held together chemical bond element silver gold found uncombined relatively pure native element mineral nearly naturally occurring element occur earth compound mixture air mostly mixture molecular nitrogen oxygen though contain compound including carbon dioxide water well atomic argon noble gas chemically inert therefore undergo chemical reaction history discovery use element began early human society discovered native mineral like carbon sulfur copper gold though modern concept element yet understood attempt classify material resulted concept classical element alchemy similar theory throughout history much modern understanding element developed work dmitri mendeleev russian chemist published first recognizable periodic table table organizes element increasing atomic number row period column group share recurring periodic physical chemical property periodic table summarizes various property element allowing chemist derive relationship make prediction element yet discovered potential new compound november international union pure applied chemistry iupac recognized total element first occur naturally earth remaining synthetic element produced nuclear reaction save unstable radioactive element radioelements decay quickly nearly element available industrially varying amount discovery synthesis new element ongoing area scientific study description lightest element hydrogen helium created big bang nucleosynthesis first minute universe ratio around mass number atom along tiny trace next two element lithium beryllium almost element found nature made various natural method nucleosynthesis earth small amount new atom naturally produced nucleogenic reaction cosmogenic process cosmic ray spallation new atom also naturally produced earth radiogenic daughter isotope ongoing radioactive decay process alpha decay

Rock fever,"Rock fever and island fever are colloquial terms for a form of mental distress said to mainly afflict mainlanders who move to isolated islands, especially any of the Hawaiian islands or Guam. It is not a medical term or classification and has not been the focus of any serious research. It has been described as ""an ailment"" of feeling ""stifled by [the island's] size and isolation"", making its sufferers ""anxious, irritated, desperate, and claustrophobic."" It is often ascribed to homesickness. Rock fever has also been described as a feeling of isolation that could arise in any isolated place and afflict anyone, including native inhabitants.

Zealandia,"Zealandia (pronounced ), also known as Te Riu-a-Māui (Māori) or Tasmantis (from Tasman Sea), is an almost entirely submerged mass of continental crust in Oceania that subsided after breaking away from Gondwana 83–79 million years ago. It has been described variously as a submerged continent, continental fragment, and microcontinent. The name and concept for Zealandia was proposed by Bruce Luyendyk in 1995, and satellite imagery shows it to be almost the size of Australia. A 2021 study suggests Zealandia is over a billion years old, about twice as old as geologists previously thought.
By approximately 23 million years ago, the landmass may have been completely submerged. Today, most of the landmass (94%) remains submerged beneath the Pacific Ocean. New Zealand is the largest part of Zealandia that is above sea level, followed by New Caledonia.
Mapping of Zealandia concluded in 2023. With a total area of approximately 4,900,000 km2 (1,900,000 sq mi), Zealandia is substantially larger than any features termed microcontinents and continental fragments. If classified as a microcontinent, Zealandia would be the world's largest microcontinent. Its area is six times the area of the next-largest microcontinent, Madagascar, and more than half the exposed land area of the Australian continent. Zealandia is more than twice the size of the largest intraoceanic large igneous province (LIP) in the world, the Ontong Java Plateau (approximately 1,900,000 km2 or 730,000 sq mi), and the world's largest island, Greenland (2,166,086 km2 or 836,330 sq mi). Zealandia is also substantially larger than the Arabian Peninsula (3,237,500 km2 or 1,250,000 sq mi), the world's largest peninsula, and the Indian subcontinent (4,300,000 km2 or 1,700,000 sq mi). Due to these and other geological considerations, such as crustal thickness and density, some geologists from New Zealand, New Caledonia, and Australia have concluded that Zealandia fulfills all the requirements to be considered a continent rather than a microcontinent or continental fragment. Geologist Nick Mortimer commented that if it were not for the ocean level, it would have been recognised as such long ago.
Zealandia supports substantial inshore fisheries and contains gas fields, of which the largest known is the New Zealand Maui gas field, near Taranaki. Permits for oil exploration in the Great South Basin were issued in 2007. Offshore mineral resources include ironsands, volcanic massive sulfides and ferromanganese nodule deposits.

Etymology
GNS Science recognises two names for the landmass. In English, the most common name is Zealandia, a latinate name for New Zealand; the name was coined in the mid-1990s and became established through common use. In the Māori language, the landmass is named Te Riu-a-Māui, meaning 'the hills, valleys, and plains of Māui'.

Geology
The Zealandia continent is largely made up of two nearly parallel ridges, separated by a failed rift, where the rift breakup of the continent stops and becomes a filled graben. The ridges rise above the sea floor to heights of 1,000–1,500 m (3,300–4,900 ft), with a few rocky islands rising above sea level. The ridges are continental rock, but are lower in elevation than normal continents because their crust is thinner than usual, approximately 20 km (12 mi) thick, and consequently, they do not float so high above Earth's mantle as that of most landmasses.
About 25 million years ago, the southern part of Zealandia (on the Pacific Plate) began to shift relative to the northern part (on the Indo-Australian Plate). The resulting displacement by approximately 500 km (310 mi) along the Alpine Fault is evident in geological maps. Movement along this plate boundary also has offset the New Caledonia Basin from its previous continuation through the Bounty Trough.
Compression across the boundary has uplifted the Southern Alps, although due to rapid erosion their height reflects only a small fraction of the uplift. Farther north, subduction of the Pacific Plate has led to extensive volcanism, including the Coromandel and Taupō Volcanic Zones. Associated rifting and subsidence has produced the Hauraki Rift and more recently, the Whakatane Graben and Wanganui Basin.

Volcanism
Volcanism on Zealandia has taken place repeatedly in various parts of the continental fragment before, during, and after it rifted away from the supercontinent Gondwana. Although Zealandia has shifted approximately 6,000 km (3,700 mi) to the northwest with respect to the underlying mantle from the time when it rifted from Antarctica, recurring intracontinental volcanism exhibits magma composition similar to that of volcanoes in previously adjacent parts of Antarctica and Australia. Large volume magmatism occurred in two periods, being in the Devonian (370 to 368 million years ago) and the Early Cretaceous (129 to 105 million years ago). 
This volcanism is widespread across Zealandia, but on present land generally it is of low volume apart from the huge m",Continents,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zealandia,1,zealandia pronounced also known te riuamāui māori tasmantis tasman sea almost entirely submerged mass continental crust oceania subsided breaking away gondwana – million year ago described variously submerged continent continental fragment microcontinent name concept zealandia proposed bruce luyendyk satellite imagery show almost size australia study suggests zealandia billion year old twice old geologist previously thought approximately million year ago landmass may completely submerged today landmass remains submerged beneath pacific ocean new zealand largest part zealandia sea level followed new caledonia mapping zealandia concluded total area approximately km sq mi zealandia substantially larger feature termed microcontinents continental fragment classified microcontinent zealandia would world largest microcontinent area six time area nextlargest microcontinent madagascar half exposed land area australian continent zealandia twice size largest intraoceanic large igneous province lip world ontong java plateau approximately km sq mi world largest island greenland km sq mi zealandia also substantially larger arabian peninsula km sq mi world largest peninsula indian subcontinent km sq mi due geological consideration crustal thickness density geologist new zealand new caledonia australia concluded zealandia fulfills requirement considered continent rather microcontinent continental fragment geologist nick mortimer commented ocean level would recognised long ago zealandia support substantial inshore fishery contains gas field largest known new zealand maui gas field near taranaki permit oil exploration great south basin issued offshore mineral resource include ironsands volcanic massive sulfide ferromanganese nodule deposit etymology gns science recognises two name landmass english common name zealandia latinate name new zealand name coined mids became established common use māori language landmass named te riuamāui meaning hill valley plain māui geology zealandia continent largely made two nearly parallel ridge separated failed rift rift breakup continent stop becomes filled graben ridge rise sea floor height – – ft rocky island rising sea level ridge continental rock lower elevation normal continent crust thinner usual approximately km mi thick consequently float high earth mantle landmass million year ago southern part zealandia pacific plate began shift relative northern part indoaustralian plate resulting displacement approximately km mi along alpine fault evident geological map movement along plate boundary also offset new caledonia basin previous continuation bounty trough compression across boundary uplifted southern alp although due rapid erosion height reflects small fraction uplift farther north subduction pacific plate led extensive volcanism including coromandel taupō volcanic zone associated rifting subsidence produced hauraki rift recently whakatane graben wanganui basin volcanism volcanism zealandia taken place repeatedly various part continental fragment rifted away supercontinent gondwana although zealandia shifted approximately km mi northwest respect underlying mantle time rifted antarctica recurring intracontinental volcanism exhibit magma composition similar volcano previously adjacent part antarctica australia large volume magmatism occurred two period devonian million year ago early cretaceous million year ago volcanism widespread across zealandia present land generally low volume apart huge
Island range,"An island range is a mountain range that exists in total or almost total isolation from a larger chain of ranges and sub-ranges. From a distance on the plains, these ranges appear as ""islands"" of higher ground. They are often described as islands of mountainous land because they exist in the ""sea"" of lower elevation and flatter prairie country; many examples are found in the northern Rocky Mountains of the United States.  Island ranges include the Big Snowy Mountains of east-central Montana, the Crazy Mountains of south-central Montana, or the  Wichita Mountains of southwestern  Oklahoma. Island ranges, due to their isolation, often have animal and/or plant species or subspecies found nowhere else.

Netflix Prize,"The Netflix Prize was an open competition for the best collaborative filtering algorithm to predict user ratings for films, based on previous ratings without any other information about the users or films, i.e. without the users being identified except by numbers assigned for the contest.
The competition was held by Netflix, a video streaming service, and was open to anyone who was neither connected with Netflix (current and former employees, agents, close relatives of Netflix employees, etc.) nor a resident of certain blocked countries (such as Cuba or North Korea). On September 21, 2009, the grand prize of US$1,000,000 was given to the BellKor's Pragmatic Chaos team which bested Netflix's own algorithm for predicting ratings by 10.06%.

Problem and data sets
Netflix provided a training data set of 100,480,507 ratings that 480,189 users gave to 17,770 movies. Each training rating is a quadruplet of the form <user, movie, date of grade, grade>. The user and movie fields are integer IDs, while grades are from 1 to 5 (integer) stars.
The qualifying data set contains over 2,817,131 triplets of the form <user, movie, date of grade>, with grades known only to the jury. A participating team's algorithm must predict grades on the entire qualifying set, but they are informed of the score for only half of the data: a quiz set of 1,408,342 ratings. The other half is the test set of 1,408,789, and performance on this is used by the jury to determine potential prize winners. Only the judges know which ratings are in the quiz set, and which are in the test set—this arrangement is intended to make it difficult to hill climb on the test set. Submitted predictions are scored against the true grades in the form of root mean squared error (RMSE), and the goal is to reduce this error as much as possible. Note that, while the actual grades are integers in the range 1 to 5, submitted predictions need not be. Netflix also identified a probe subset of 1,408,395 ratings within the training data set. The probe, quiz, and test data sets were chosen to have similar statistical properties.
In summary, the data used in the Netflix Prize looks as follows:

Training set (99,072,112 ratings not including the probe set; 100,480,507 including the probe set)
Probe set (1,408,395 ratings)
Qualifying set (2,817,131 ratings) consisting of:
Test set (1,408,789 ratings), used to determine winners
Quiz set (1,408,342 ratings), used to calculate leaderboard scores
For each movie, the title and year of release are provided in a separate dataset. No information at all is provided about users. In order to protect the privacy of the customers, ""some of the rating data for some customers in the training and qualifying sets have been deliberately perturbed in one or more of the following ways: deleting ratings; inserting alternative ratings and dates; and modifying rating dates.""
The training set is constructed such that the average user rated over 200 movies, and the average movie was rated by over 5000 users. But there is wide variance in the data—some movies in the training set have as few as 3 ratings, while one user rated over 17,000 movies.
There was some controversy as to the choice of RMSE as the defining metric. It has been claimed that even as small an improvement as 1% RMSE results in a significant difference in the ranking of the ""top-10"" most recommended movies for a user.

Prizes
Prizes were based on improvement over Netflix's own algorithm, called Cinematch, or the previous year's score if a team has made improvement beyond a certain threshold. A trivial algorithm that predicts for each movie in the quiz set its average grade from the training data produces an RMSE of 1.0540. Cinematch uses ""straightforward statistical linear models with a lot of data conditioning."" The performance of Cinematch had plateaued by 2006.
Using only the training data, Cinematch scores an RMSE of 0.9514 on the quiz data, roughly a 10% improvement over the trivial algorithm. Cinematch has a similar performance on the test set, 0.9525. In order to win the grand prize of $1,000,000, a participating team had to improve this by another 10%, to achieve 0.8572 on the test set. Such an improvement on the quiz set corresponds to an RMSE of 0.8563.
As long as no team won the grand prize, a progress prize of $50,000 was awarded every year for the best result thus far. However, in order to win this prize, an algorithm had to improve the RMSE on the quiz set by at least 1% over the previous progress prize winner (or over Cinematch, the first year). If no submission succeeded, the progress prize was not to be awarded for that year.
To win a progress or grand prize a participant had to provide source code and a description of the algorithm to the jury within one week after being contacted by them. Following verification the winner also had to provide a non-exclusive license to Netflix. Netflix would publish only the description, not the source code, of the system.

Economics in film,"Portrayals of economics in film include the depiction of economic principles, themes, and concepts within cinematic narratives. Films often use economic elements as part of their stories, even when not explicitly focused on economics. Films can incorporate economic ideas into their narratives, often without the audience consciously recognizing them.
The integration of economic principles include portrayals of consumption decisions, resource allocation, and production costs. Film has been used as a tool to illustrate economic principles, and numerous academic and popular works explore its potential in teaching economics. By embedding economic ideas into storytelling, films reveal the pervasive nature of economic principles and their relevance to everyday life, illustrating the connections between theoretical concepts and real-world decision-making.

Background
Economics is an inescapable reality of human existence, as noted by Alfred Marshall, who described the discipline as examining ""that part of individual and social action which is most closely connected with the attainment and with the use of the material requisites of well-being"". The omnipresence of economics in daily life, from personal budgeting decisions to global resource allocation, ensures its inevitable presence in cinematic storytelling. Films as diverse as Workers Leaving the Lumière Factory (1895) and A Corner in Wheat (1909) illustrate how economic themes have been central to film since its inception.
Film's depiction of economic principles mirrors the work of economists. Just as economic models simplify reality to focus on critical factors, films create symbolic worlds with enough realism to be credible. This parallelism extends to the exploration of human behavior under constraints such as laws, institutions, and social norms. For instance, films like The Big Short (2015) and The Wolf of Wall Street (2013) not only depict financial crises and speculative behavior but also challenge audiences to reflect on the motivations and consequences of economic decision-making.
The bidirectional relationship between film and economics is noteworthy. While economic conditions influence the content and themes of films, films significantly shape public perceptions of economics and economic policies. The disparity between the reach of films like The Big Short, which sold 8.2 million tickets in the United States alone, and Thomas Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century (2013), which sold 2.5 million copies worldwide, underscores film's broader cultural impact. Additionally, films such as Blood Diamond (2006) and Dark Waters (2019) have served as catalysts for socio-economic discourse and policy change.
Cinematic narratives often convey a dismissive attitude toward economics and markets, reflecting broader societal anxieties and misunderstandings. Such portrayals reveal valuable insights into public attitudes and the generational perspectives of filmmakers and audiences. While critics often accuse filmmakers of bias or ignorance, these depictions serve as a cultural commentary on the discipline's perceived limitations and societal implications.

Film,"A film, also known as a movie or motion picture, is a work of visual art that simulates experiences and otherwise communicates ideas, stories, perceptions, emotions, or atmosphere through the use of moving images that are generally, since the 1930s, synchronized with sound and (less commonly) other sensory stimulations.

Etymology and alternative terms
The name ""film"" originally referred to the thin layer of photochemical emulsion on the celluloid strip that used to be the actual medium for recording and displaying motion pictures.
Many other terms exist for an individual motion-picture, including ""picture"", ""picture show"", ""moving picture"", ""photoplay"", and ""flick"". The most common term in the United States is ""movie"", while in Europe, ""film"" is preferred. Archaic terms include ""animated pictures"" and ""animated photography"".
""Flick"" is, in general a slang term, first recorded in 1926. It originates in the verb flicker, owing to the flickering appearance of early films.
Common terms for the field, in general, include ""the big screen"", ""the movies"", ""the silver screen"", and ""cinema""; the last of these is commonly used, as an overarching term, in scholarly texts and critical essays. In the early years, the word ""sheet"" was sometimes used instead of ""screen"".
The word ""cinema"" is borrowed from the French cinéma, an abbreviation of cinématographe (term coined by the Lumière brothers in the 1890s), from Ancient Greek meaning ""recording movement"". The word is today usually used to refer to either a purpose-built venue for screening films, known as a movie theater in the US; the film industry; the overall art form of specifically just filmmaking.

Recording and transmission of the film
The moving images of a film are created by photographing actual scenes with a motion-picture camera, by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques, by means of CGI and computer animation, or by a combination of some or all of these techniques, and other visual effects.
Before the introduction of digital production, a series of still images were recorded on a strip of chemically sensitized celluloid (photographic film stock), usually at a rate of 24 frames per second. The images are transmitted through a movie projector at the same rate as they were recorded, with a Geneva drive ensuring that each frame remains still during its short projection time. A rotating shutter causes stroboscopic intervals of darkness, but the viewer does not notice the interruptions due to flicker fusion. The apparent motion on the screen is the result of the fact that the visual sense cannot discern the individual images at high speeds, so the impressions of the images blend with the dark intervals and are thus linked together to produce the illusion of one moving image. An analogous optical soundtrack (a graphic recording of the spoken words, music, and other sounds) runs along a portion of the film exclusively reserved for it, and was not projected.
Contemporary films are usually fully digital through the entire process of production, distribution, and exhibition.

History
Precursors
The art of film has drawn on several earlier traditions in fields such as oral storytelling, literature, theatre and visual arts. Forms of art and entertainment that had already featured moving or projected images include:

shadowgraphy, probably practised since prehistoric times
camera obscura, a natural phenomenon that has possibly been used as an artistic aid since prehistoric times
shadow puppetry, possibly originated around 200 BCE in Central Asia, India, Indonesia or China
The magic lantern, developed in the 1650s. The multi-media phantasmagoria shows with magic lanterns were popular from 1790 throughout the first half of the 19th century and could feature mechanical slides, rear projection, mobile projectors, superimposition, dissolving views, live actors, smoke (sometimes to project images upon), odors, sounds and electric shocks.

Before celluloid
The stroboscopic animation principle was introduced in 1833 with the stroboscopic disc (better known as the phénakisticope) and later applied in the zoetrope (since 1866), the flip book (since 1868), and the praxinoscope (since 1877), before it became the basic principle for cinematography.
Experiments with early phénakisticope-based animation projectors were made at least as early as 1843 and publicly screened in 1847. Jules Duboscq marketed phénakisticope projection systems in France from c. 1853 until the 1890s.
Photography was introduced in 1839, but initially photographic emulsions needed such long exposures that the recording of moving subjects seemed impossible. At least as early as 1844, photographic series of subjects posed in different positions were created to either suggest a motion sequence or document a range of different viewing angles.

Examples of fog deserts include the Atacama Desert of coastal Chile and Peru; the Baja California desert of Mexico; the Namib Desert in Namibia; the Arabian Peninsula coastal fog desert; and a manmade instance within Biosphere 2, an artificial closed ecosphere in Arizona.

Formation
Humidity in foggy air is above 95%. One way for fog to form in deserts is through the interaction of hot humid air (such as is formed above warm bodies of water) with a cooler object, such as a mountain. When warm air hits cooler objects, fog is generated by the condensation of vaporized water. Another way fog forms in deserts occurs when a desert is close to an ocean which has a cold current. When air is heated over desert land and blows towards the cool water in the ocean, it condenses and fog is formed. The cool fog is then blown inland by the ocean breeze. Fog is mainly formed in the early morning or after sunset.
Drastic changes in elevation such as mountain ranges allow for maritime winds to settle in specific geographic areas, which is a common characteristic in fog deserts. The Andes mountain range which runs along the Pacific coast of South America divides Chile and Peru into inland and coastal regions, and its proximity to the sea coupled with the steep change in elevation (and thus surface temperature) allow for fog to form along the Pacific coast and supply moisture to the otherwise arid desert. 
The Atacama Desert, the driest desert in the world, features lomas, areas in which fog condenses against mountain slopes near the sea and creates ""fog oases"" with an abundant biodiversity of plant and animal species. Plant coverage varies greatly, from coverage as high as 50% in the foggiest areas to a near-total absence of plant life above the fog line. 
Within arid fog deserts with low precipitation levels, fog drip provides the moisture needed for agricultural development. The variation in humidity throughout the day and seasons within a fog desert region encourage the development of a comparable diversity of plant types and habits such as succulents, deciduous species, and woody shrub.

Ecology
The species prevalent in fog deserts depend almost entirely on water contained in the fog for their survival. This has led to the development of various structural and behavioral adaptations by organisms to collect water. The Stenocara beetle, which lives in the Namib desert, climbs sand dunes when the humid wind is blowing from the ocean to access the ambient water.  An example of plants adapting to the fog desert's climate is the genus Welwitschia which also grows in the Namib desert and grows only two leaves through its life. The leaves have large pores to help it absorb water from the fog forming on them.

People living in the Namib depend on techniques to collect water from fog. A lot of technologies are being developed to help extract water from desert air. Fog harvesters are undergoing improvements based on observations of the adaptations of some of the beings in fog deserts like the Stenocara beetle. Devices being developed to extract water from air desert use metal-organic framework crystals to capture and hold water molecules when exposed to air flow at night. In the morning, air flow is cut and the water collected previous night is then vaporized by exposure to sunlight and then condensed into liquid water when it hits the cooler condenser.

Co-operative economics,"Cooperative (or co-operative) economics is a field of economics that incorporates cooperative studies and political economy toward the study and management of cooperatives.

History
Cooperative economics developed as both a theory and a concrete alternative to industrial capitalism in the late 1700s and early 1800s. As such, it was a form of stateless socialism. The term socialism, in fact, was coined in The Cooperative Magazine in 1827. Such socialisms arose in response to the negative effects of industrialism, where various clergymen, workers, and industrialists in England, such as Robert Owen, experimented with various models of collective farming and community housing with varying degrees of success. This movement was often integrated with other progressive movements of the era such as women's suffrage and abolitionism. ""British industrialist Robert Owen (1771–1858) founded a model factory town around his cotton mill and later established a model socialist community, New Harmony, in Indiana. Some proponents of women's rights, such as Emma Martin (1812–1851) in Britain and Flora Tristan (1801–1844) in France, stirred controversy by promoting socialism as the solution to female oppression.""While state socialism was growing popular, rising in the early 1900s, followed by collapse in the 20th century, the cooperative movement grew exponentially in all countries affected by socialism and British colonialism, such as Canada, the U.S., South Africa, and across Europe. Jessica Gordon Nembhard has produced one of the most thorough academic monographs on cooperative economics entitled Collective Courage: A History of African American Cooperative Economic Thought and Practice, which looks at how African American communities organized to survive white nationalism, capitalism, and colonialism in the 20th century. The International Cooperative Alliance (ICA) was formed in 1895 and National Cooperative Business Association founded in 1916.
The post-WWII era experienced a decline in interest towards cooperatives in the economics profession, with much lower quality and quantity of the discussion on cooperatives in economics text books published after the war compared to those published before the war. 

The University of Wisconsin Center for Cooperatives was founded in 1962, which was possibly the first organization to collect data on cooperatives. In 2000, the Democracy Collaborative was created out of the University of Maryland, which – among other things – facilitates the creation and development of cooperatives. In 2004 the United States Federation of Worker Cooperatives (USFWC) was founded, which, like the ICA, facilitates worker cooperatives (see ""Types and Structures of Cooperatives"" below). The ongoing success of cooperative economics in providing more effective alternatives to capitalist firms was so significant by the 21st century that the United Nations Assembly ""...declared 2012 as the International Year of Cooperatives, highlighting the contribution of cooperatives to socio-economic development, in particular recognizing their impact on poverty reduction, employment generation and social integration."" 
Contemporary cooperative economics has gained even further popularity since 2012, with numerous TED talks dedicated to the subject; they demonstrate how cooperative economics is able to solve problems in housing, food, and poverty that modern industrial countries have so far been unable to solve. In 2013, the USFWC spawned the Democracy at Work Institute, a sister organization that also facilitates the growth, creation, and conversion of worker cooperatives.
In February of 2024, the United Nations General Assembly declared 2025 the ""UN International Year of Cooperatives.""

Types and structures of cooperatives
General structures
There are generally five major types of cooperative organizations:

Consumers' cooperatives, in which the consumers of a co-operative's goods and services are defined as its members (including retail food co-operatives and grocery stores, credit unions, mutual insurance companies, etc.) (Example: REI, federal credit unions, etc.)
Worker cooperatives, which are co-owned and democratically co-managed by workers/contributors. (Example: Home-Care Associates, The Driver's Cooperative, Means TV, etc.)
Producer Cooperative (or ""Contributor"" Cooperative), which are co-owned by major producers/contributors instead of every worker. (Example: Stewart Healthcare, Land O’ Lakes, OceanSpray, Zen-Ho)
Retailer-Owned Cooperative, where store-owners are shareholders of the larger company and therefore receive patronage dividends. (""Retail cooperative,"" confusingly, also can refer to consumer cooperatives that have a retail storefront.) (Example: Ace Hardware, True Value, NAPA Autoparts).
Purchasing Cooperative (or ""Supply"" or ""Distribution"" Cooperative), which are co-owned by member organizations, which consolidate into a group in order to aggregate demand (i.e., buy in bulk)—which reduces purchase cost",Economics,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-operative_economics,0,cooperative cooperative economics field economics incorporates cooperative study political economy toward study management cooperative history cooperative economics developed theory concrete alternative industrial capitalism late early form stateless socialism term socialism fact coined cooperative magazine socialism arose response negative effect industrialism various clergyman worker industrialist england robert owen experimented various model collective farming community housing varying degree success movement often integrated progressive movement era womens suffrage abolitionism british industrialist robert owen – founded model factory town around cotton mill later established model socialist community new harmony indiana proponent womens right emma martin – britain flora tristan – france stirred controversy promoting socialism solution female oppressionwhile state socialism growing popular rising early followed collapse th century cooperative movement grew exponentially country affected socialism british colonialism canada u south africa across europe jessica gordon nembhard produced one thorough academic monograph cooperative economics entitled collective courage history african american cooperative economic thought practice look african american community organized survive white nationalism capitalism colonialism th century international cooperative alliance ica formed national cooperative business association founded postwwii era experienced decline interest towards cooperative economics profession much lower quality quantity discussion cooperative economics text book published war compared published war university wisconsin center cooperative founded possibly first organization collect data cooperative democracy collaborative created university maryland – among thing – facilitates creation development cooperative united state federation worker cooperative usfwc founded like ica facilitates worker cooperative see type structure cooperative ongoing success cooperative economics providing effective alternative capitalist firm significant st century united nation assembly declared international year cooperative highlighting contribution cooperative socioeconomic development particular recognizing impact poverty reduction employment generation social integration contemporary cooperative economics gained even popularity since numerous ted talk dedicated subject demonstrate cooperative economics able solve problem housing food poverty modern industrial country far unable solve usfwc spawned democracy work institute sister organization also facilitates growth creation conversion worker cooperative february united nation general assembly declared un international year cooperative type structure cooperative general structure generally five major type cooperative organization consumer cooperative consumer cooperative good service defined member including retail food cooperative grocery store credit union mutual insurance company etc example rei federal credit union etc worker cooperative coowned democratically comanaged workerscontributors example homecare associate driver cooperative mean tv etc producer cooperative contributor cooperative coowned major producerscontributors instead every worker example stewart healthcare land ’ lake oceanspray zenho retailerowned cooperative storeowners shareholder larger company therefore receive patronage dividend retail cooperative confusingly also refer consumer cooperative retail storefront example ace hardware true value napa autoparts purchasing cooperative supply distribution cooperative coowned member organization consolidate group order aggregate demand ie buy bulk—which reduces purchase cost
International Mountain Society,"The International Mountain Society  (IMS) is a scientific  research society focusing on the dissemination of information about mountain research and mountain development throughout the world, but particularly in developing regions. IMS is the copyright-holder and co-publisher, along with the United Nations University (UNU), of  the quarterly journal Mountain Research and Development (MRD). IMS was incorporated in Boulder, Colorado in 1980. Since 2000 the IMS has been based in Bern, Switzerland. 
Membership in the IMS, which includes subscription to MRD, is available to individuals and to organizations.

Aims
The mission statement of both the IMS and its journal, Mountain Research and Development, is ""to strive for a better balance between mountain environment, development of resources and the well-being of mountain peoples."" The practical purpose of the IMS was to provide a vehicle for collaboration with United Nations University in the publication of a new mountain research and applied study journal. The intent was to build on the expanding commitments of a number of international institutions that were beginning to respond to the perceived widespread problems facing the mountains and mountain peoples of the world.

History
The International Mountain Society grew out of multidisciplinary collaborations of participants in the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Programme (MAB), especially MAB Project 6 (study of the impact of human activities on mountain ecosystems). IMS and the new journal, MRD, were aided financially and intellectually by the UNU,  Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Hochgebirgsforschung, UNESCO, the Commission on High Altitude Geoecology of the International Geographical Union (IGU), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN). The intellectual underpinnings included the Biosphere Reserve concept that was applied by UNESCO in promoting research, training, and genepool conservation in designated areas, as well as the UNU's approach to mountain research that emphasized the importance of highland-lowland interactive systems.
The specific impetus for the founding of the IMS stemmed from 1974 conference on the Development of Mountain Environment that was convened by the German Technical Cooperation Agency (GTZ) in Munich. Participants, including John Cool, Frank Davidson, Klaus Lampe, A.D.Moddie, Joseph Stein, B.B. Vohra, and Jack D. Ives, concluded that there was a need for an organization linking mountain researchers and institutions and also for a journal focused on mountain research. These points came up again in a 1976 workshop convened in Cambridge, Massachusetts. At the time of incorporation in Boulder, Colorado, the officers of IMF were:

President: Jack D. Ives, University of Colorado, Boulder, USA
Vice-President: Corneille Jest, Centre national de la recherche scientifique, Paris, France
Vice-President: Heinz Loeffler, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria
Secretary: Roger G. Barry, University of Colorado Boulder, USA
Treasurer: Misha Plam, University of Colorado, Boulder, USA

Achievements
The primary product of the International Mountain Society is the quarterly peer-reviewed journal Mountain Research and Development. The editorial policies emphasize  the need for accelerated interdisciplinary international research, both pure and applied. The membership of the founding editorial and advisory boards was international, representing sixteen nations, and special attention was paid to facilitating publication in English of manuscripts submitted in any language.
	MRD was edited by Jack Ives and Pauline Ives, and Jack Ives also served as President of the IMS until  2000, when both the journal and the organization were transferred to Bern University, Switzerland, with Hans Hürni assuming responsibility.  
	MRD has been able to ensure worldwide publication of a wide range of mountain research results. Serving as a linkage between many international institutions, universities, and NGOs, in collaboration with Maurice Strong, Secretary General of  the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), also known as the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit, the IMS contributed to the adoption of Chapter 13: Mountains o  Agenda 21, the Rio action plan. This, in turn, led to the United Nations designation of 2002 as the International Year of Mountains and  December 11 as the annual International Mountain Day.

Flatness (art),"In art criticism of the 1960s and 1970s, flatness described the smoothness and absence of curvature or surface detail of a two-dimensional work of art.

Views
Critic Clement Greenberg believed that flatness, or two-dimensionality, was an essential and desirable quality in painting, a criterion which implies rejection of painterliness and impasto.  The valorization of flatness led to a number of art movements, including minimalism and post-painterly abstractionism.
Modernism in the arts appeared during the second half of the 19th century and extended into most of the 20th. This period of art is identified by art forms consisting of an image on a flat two-dimensional surface. This art evolution began in the 1860s and culminated 50 years later. By this time almost all three-dimensional works had been eliminated. This new approach to painting was to create a visual appearance of realism. Looking at a surface with only two dimensions our perception of depth is an illusion. The reduction of depth in painting was the consequence of investigation. This new essence of self-analysis attempted to establish an experience or effect from the viewer of the painting.

Terminology and history
The term flatness can be used to describe much of the popular American art work of the 1950s and 1960s. The art of this period had a basic yet colorful design that held a degree of two dimensional form. Thus the term flatness is used to describe this medium. The groundwork idea for Minimalism began in Russia in 1913 when Kazimir Malevich placed a black square on a white background claiming that: 

Art no longer cares to serve the state and religion it no longer wishes to illustrate the history of manners, it wants to have nothing further to do with the object as such, and believes that it can exist in and for itself without things.
One of the first Minimalism artworks was created in 1964 by Dan Flavin. He produced a neon sculpture titled Monument for V. Tatlin. This work was a simplistic assembly of neon tubes that were not carved or constructed in any way. The idea was that they were not supposed to symbolize anything but to just merely exist. The Minimalist approach to art was to conceive by the mind before execution. Traditional modes of art composition were rejected in favor of improvisation, spontaneity and automatism. This new expressionist style consisted of improvised pattern making where every stroke of the brush was viewed as expression and subjective freedom.

Pop Art
This concept inspired a whole new art form called Pop Art. It retained the color scheme and simplicity of Minimalism, but it borrowed images from pop culture to become relatable. The works now in question held a meaning for the viewer with familiar imagery but it still retained the avant-garde approach of Minimalism. Pop Art is a well-recognized movement in 1960s culture. This type of art was very free-form fashionable and rebellious. It was wild and colorful but many works retained the idea of two dimensional flatness.

Op Art
Pop Art fell out of fashion and a new movement came into being. Op Art or Optic Art was now the latest trend in home décor and fashion. This form of modern art shares a strong relationship with the culture thought and design of the 1960s. This new art form focused on non-objective painting that focused on design, color, form, and line. These paintings were hand-drawn or created with a mechanical aid. They featured a flat-looking two dimensional design that could appear to pop out in an almost three dimensional form. Some pieces look as if they are moving due to shape and line placement creating a trick of the eye. This form of art was created to test the limits of the conscious perception of the viewer.
Bright colors were no longer favored, as much of Op Art is black and white with little use of color. The designs presented migrated back to the Minimalist idea of art simply existing and not representing an ideal. A well noted artist of this style is Bridget Riley who shaped the contemporary art scene of the early 50s and 70s. Her works are designed to pull the eye in such a way to stretch and disorder the perceptual sense. She is considered a ground-breaking artist in the realm of modern art. Her work mainly consists of detailed line and circle patterns to create an optical challenge for the viewer.
Riley composes her art with the thought in mind that we all have a narrow view on how we see things and our vision is rarely stretched to new abilities. Her work confronts the observer with new imaginative sensations, and the overall purpose of the artist's disappears and is replaced with what the viewer conceives. This form of art has no clear outlined theme therefore it allows total freedom for one to compose their imagination. Riley's work ignores object and instead focuses on visual movement to create a seemingly endless pattern. Riley's art appeared in the fashion of that era. Similar patterns still remain popular in clothing today.

Island restoration,"The ecological restoration of islands, or island restoration, is the application of the principles of ecological restoration to islands and island groups. Islands, due to their isolation, are home to many of the world's endemic species, as well as important breeding grounds for seabirds and some marine mammals. Their ecosystems are also very vulnerable to human disturbance and particularly to introduced species, due to their small size. Island groups, such as New Zealand and Hawaii, have undergone substantial extinctions and losses of habitat. Since the 1950s several organisations and government agencies around the world have worked to restore islands to their original states; New Zealand has used them to hold natural populations of species that would otherwise be unable to survive in the wild. The principal components of island restoration are the removal of introduced species and the reintroduction of native species.

Islands, endemism and extinction
Isolated islands have been known to have greater levels of endemism since the 1970s when the theory of island biogeography, formulated by Robert MacArthur and E.O. Wilson, was developed. This higher occurrence of endemism is because isolation limits immigration of new species to the island, allowing new species to evolve separately from others on the mainland. For example, 71% of New Zealand's bird species (prior to human arrival) were endemic. As well as displaying greater levels of endemism, island species have characteristics that make them particularly vulnerable to human disturbance.
Many island species evolved on small islands, or even restricted habitats on small islands. Small populations are vulnerable to even modest hunting, and restricted habitats are vulnerable to loss or modification of said habitat. More importantly, island species are often ecologically naive, that is they have not evolved alongside a predator, or have lost appropriate behavioural responses to predators. This often resulted in flightlessness, or unusual levels of tameness. This made many species susceptible to hunting (it is thought, for example, that moas were hunted to extinction in a few short generations) and to predation by introduced species. Some, such as the dodo, are thought to have become extinct because of the pressure of both humans and introduced animals. One estimate of birds in the Pacific islands puts the extinctions at 2000 species. Between 40 and 50% of the bird species of New Zealand have become extinct since 200 AD.

The field of island restoration is usually credited with having been started in New Zealand in the 1960s, but other smaller projects, such as the restoration of Nonsuch Island in Bermuda (which began in 1962) have been going on for almost as long. Nevertheless, the program undertaken by the Department of Conservation (DOC) is one of the largest in the world. It began on Cuvier Island, where ecologists removed stock, goats, feral cats and finally, in 1993, Pacific rats. The success of the project resulted in similar projects around New Zealand. The advantages to the DOC were considerable; in addition to protecting species endemic to smaller islands, like the magenta petrel, islands near the mainland, once restored, could act as habitat for species of birds that were unable to survive on the mainland. Species like the takahē, where the remaining wild population was at considerable risk from feral cats and dogs, could be moved to these islands to safeguard the species.

Eradication of introduced alien species
One important aspect of island restoration is the removal of invasive alien species. Since these species are most often the reason that native fauna and flora is threatened, their removal is essential to the restoration project. From 1673 until 2009, 786 successful invasive vertebrate eradication have been recorded and in the last few decades the frequency of eradications and the size of islands from which invasive vertebrates have been eradicated has increased. A definitive list of past island restoration efforts exists as the Database of Island Invasive Species Eradications. In addition a list of the current invasive species present on the world's islands exists as the Threatened Island Database
Islands are particularly suitable for restoration as once cleared of an introduced species they can be kept cleared of these species by virtue of being an island. Species removal is intensive and expensive, and methods used must be carefully chosen as to not create too much impact on non-target species. Feral cats, goats and three species of rats are among the most damaging species introduced to islands (Moors & Atkinson 1984). The differences in size, lifestyle and behaviour preclude the use of the same techniques for all of them, but with many species a range of techniques needs to be used in order to ensure success. Larger animals, such as goats and pigs, can be effectively hunted; in the case of Round Island, in Mauritius, all the goats were elim",Islands,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_restoration,1,ecological restoration island island restoration application principle ecological restoration island island group island due isolation home many world endemic specie well important breeding ground seabird marine mammal ecosystem also vulnerable human disturbance particularly introduced specie due small size island group new zealand hawaii undergone substantial extinction loss habitat since several organisation government agency around world worked restore island original state new zealand used hold natural population specie would otherwise unable survive wild principal component island restoration removal introduced specie reintroduction native specie island endemism extinction isolated island known greater level endemism since theory island biogeography formulated robert macarthur eo wilson developed higher occurrence endemism isolation limit immigration new specie island allowing new specie evolve separately others mainland example new zealand bird specie prior human arrival endemic well displaying greater level endemism island specie characteristic make particularly vulnerable human disturbance many island specie evolved small island even restricted habitat small island small population vulnerable even modest hunting restricted habitat vulnerable loss modification said habitat importantly island specie often ecologically naive evolved alongside predator lost appropriate behavioural response predator often resulted flightlessness unusual level tameness made many specie susceptible hunting thought example moa hunted extinction short generation predation introduced specie dodo thought become extinct pressure human introduced animal one estimate bird pacific island put extinction specie bird specie new zealand become extinct since ad field island restoration usually credited started new zealand smaller project restoration nonsuch island bermuda began going almost long nevertheless program undertaken department conservation doc one largest world began cuvier island ecologist removed stock goat feral cat finally pacific rat success project resulted similar project around new zealand advantage doc considerable addition protecting specie endemic smaller island like magenta petrel island near mainland restored could act habitat specie bird unable survive mainland specie like takahē remaining wild population considerable risk feral cat dog could moved island safeguard specie eradication introduced alien specie one important aspect island restoration removal invasive alien specie since specie often reason native fauna flora threatened removal essential restoration project successful invasive vertebrate eradication recorded last decade frequency eradication size island invasive vertebrate eradicated increased definitive list past island restoration effort exists database island invasive specie eradication addition list current invasive specie present world island exists threatened island database island particularly suitable restoration cleared introduced specie kept cleared specie virtue island specie removal intensive expensive method used must carefully chosen create much impact nontarget specie feral cat goat three specie rat among damaging specie introduced island moor atkinson difference size lifestyle behaviour preclude use technique many specie range technique need used order ensure success larger animal goat pig effectively hunted case round island mauritius goat elim
Anastomosing stream,"An anastomosis (, pl.: anastomoses) is a connection or opening between two things (especially cavities or passages) that are normally diverging or branching, such as between blood vessels, leaf veins, or streams. Such a connection may be normal (such as the foramen ovale in a fetus' heart) or abnormal (such as the patent foramen ovale in an adult's heart); it may be acquired (such as an arteriovenous fistula) or innate (such as the arteriovenous shunt of a metarteriole); and it may be natural (such as the aforementioned examples) or artificial (such as a surgical anastomosis). The reestablishment of an anastomosis that had become blocked is called a reanastomosis. Anastomoses that are abnormal, whether congenital or acquired, are often called fistulas.
The term is used in medicine, biology, mycology, geology, and geography.

Etymology
Anastomosis: medical or Modern Latin, from Greek ἀναστόμωσις, anastomosis, ""outlet, opening"", Greek ana- ""up, on, upon"", stoma ""mouth"", ""to furnish with a mouth"". Thus the -stom- syllable is cognate with that of stoma in botany or stoma in medicine.

Medical anatomy
An anastomosis is the connection of two normally divergent structures. It refers to connections between blood vessels or between other tubular structures such as loops of intestine.

Circulatory
In circulatory anastomoses, many arteries naturally anastomose with each other; for example, the inferior epigastric artery and superior epigastric artery, or the anterior and/or posterior communicating arteries in the Circle of Willis in the brain. The circulatory anastomosis is further divided into arterial and venous anastomosis. Arterial anastomosis includes actual arterial anastomosis (e.g., palmar arch, plantar arch) and potential arterial anastomosis (e.g. coronary arteries and cortical branch of cerebral arteries). Anastomoses also form alternative routes around capillary beds in areas that do not need a large blood supply, thus helping regulate systemic blood flow.

Surgical
Surgical anastomosis occurs when segments of intestine, blood vessel, or any other structure are connected together surgically (anastomosed). Examples include arterial anastomosis in bypass surgery, intestinal anastomosis after a piece of intestine has been resected, Roux-en-Y anastomosis and ureteroureterostomy.  Surgical anastomosis techniques include linear stapled anastomosis, hand sewn anastomosis, end-to-end anastomosis (EEA). Anastomosis can be performed by hand or with an anastomosis assist device. Studies have been performed comparing various anastomosis approaches taking into account surgical ""time and cost, postoperative anastomotic bleeding, leakage, and stricture"".
Anastomotic leakage in colorectal cancer surgery
Failure of an intestinal anastomosis with leakage of intestinal content in to the abdominal cavity is one of the most severe complications after bowel surgery. The severity of anastomotic leakage varies ranging from mild with minimal impact on the patient to severe and potentially fatal, with negative impact on both short- and long-term outcomes. The incidence has not changed in recent decades, despite improvement in surgical techniques, prehabilitation and perioperative care. Anastomotic leakage after rectal cancer surgery is higher and documented to occur in 9-11%, after colon resection the incidence of leakage is lower and about 6%. Systemic factors contributing to anastomotic failure include sepsis, anemia, diabetes mellitus, previous irradiation, malnutrition, steroid use, smoking, heavy alcohol consumption, obesity and certain disease conditions like Chron's disease.
Signs of an anastomotic leak include fever, abdominal pain or peritonitis, leukocytosis and tachycardia or new-onset arrythmias. Anastomotic leakage is usually diagnosed 5-8 days post-surgery. A CT scan with pneumoperitoneum and significant free fluid or inflammatory changes around the anastomosis are suggestive of an anastomotic failure. Depending on the magnitude of the defect and leak different treatments are indicated. A localized anastomotic leak without systemic sepsis or peritonitis can be managed with antibiotics and if possible, drainage of the abscess. Anastomotic leaks associated with peritonitis or systemic sepsis requires an operation with either revision of the anastomosis if feasible or fecal diversion proximally or at the site of the anastomosis with a stoma.

Pathological
Pathological anastomosis results from trauma or disease and may involve veins, arteries, or intestines. These are usually referred to as fistulas. In the cases of veins or arteries, traumatic fistulas usually occur between artery and vein. Traumatic intestinal fistulas usually occur between two loops of intestine (entero-enteric fistula) or intestine and skin (enterocutaneous fistula). Portacaval anastomosis, by contrast, is an anastomosis between a vein of the portal circulation and a vein of the systemic circulation, which allows blood to bypass the liver in patients ",Rivers,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis,1,anastomosis pl anastomosis connection opening two thing especially cavity passage normally diverging branching blood vessel leaf vein stream connection may normal foramen ovale fetus heart abnormal patent foramen ovale adult heart may acquired arteriovenous fistula innate arteriovenous shunt metarteriole may natural aforementioned example artificial surgical anastomosis reestablishment anastomosis become blocked called reanastomosis anastomosis abnormal whether congenital acquired often called fistula term used medicine biology mycology geology geography etymology anastomosis medical modern latin greek ἀναστόμωσις anastomosis outlet opening greek ana upon stoma mouth furnish mouth thus stom syllable cognate stoma botany stoma medicine medical anatomy anastomosis connection two normally divergent structure refers connection blood vessel tubular structure loop intestine circulatory circulatory anastomosis many artery naturally anastomose example inferior epigastric artery superior epigastric artery anterior andor posterior communicating artery circle willis brain circulatory anastomosis divided arterial venous anastomosis arterial anastomosis includes actual arterial anastomosis eg palmar arch plantar arch potential arterial anastomosis eg coronary artery cortical branch cerebral artery anastomosis also form alternative route around capillary bed area need large blood supply thus helping regulate systemic blood flow surgical surgical anastomosis occurs segment intestine blood vessel structure connected together surgically anastomosed example include arterial anastomosis bypass surgery intestinal anastomosis piece intestine resected rouxeny anastomosis ureteroureterostomy surgical anastomosis technique include linear stapled anastomosis hand sewn anastomosis endtoend anastomosis eea anastomosis performed hand anastomosis assist device study performed comparing various anastomosis approach taking account surgical time cost postoperative anastomotic bleeding leakage stricture anastomotic leakage colorectal cancer surgery failure intestinal anastomosis leakage intestinal content abdominal cavity one severe complication bowel surgery severity anastomotic leakage varies ranging mild minimal impact patient severe potentially fatal negative impact short longterm outcome incidence changed recent decade despite improvement surgical technique prehabilitation perioperative care anastomotic leakage rectal cancer surgery higher documented occur colon resection incidence leakage lower systemic factor contributing anastomotic failure include sepsis anemia diabetes mellitus previous irradiation malnutrition steroid use smoking heavy alcohol consumption obesity certain disease condition like chrons disease sign anastomotic leak include fever abdominal pain peritonitis leukocytosis tachycardia newonset arrythmias anastomotic leakage usually diagnosed day postsurgery ct scan pneumoperitoneum significant free fluid inflammatory change around anastomosis suggestive anastomotic failure depending magnitude defect leak different treatment indicated localized anastomotic leak without systemic sepsis peritonitis managed antibiotic possible drainage abscess anastomotic leak associated peritonitis systemic sepsis requires operation either revision anastomosis feasible fecal diversion proximally site anastomosis stoma pathological pathological anastomosis result trauma disease may involve vein artery intestine usually referred fistula case vein artery traumatic fistula usually occur artery vein traumatic intestinal fistula usually occur two loop intestine enteroenteric fistula intestine skin enterocutaneous fistula portacaval anastomosis contrast anastomosis vein portal circulation vein systemic circulation allows blood bypass liver patient
Mountain jet,"Mountain jets are a type of jet stream created by surface winds channeled through mountain passes, sometimes causing high wind speeds and drastic temperature changes.

Central America jets
The North Pacific east of about 120°W is strongly influenced by winds blowing through gaps in the Central American cordillera. Air flow in the region forms the Intra-Americas Low-Level Jet, a westward flow about 1 km above sea level. This flow, trade winds, and cold air flowing south from North America contribute to winds flowing through several mountain valleys.
Along Central America are three main wind jets through breaks in the American Cordillera, on the Pacific Ocean side due to prevailing winds.

Tehuano wind blows from the Gulf of Mexico through Chivela Pass in Mexico's Isthmus of Tehuantepec and out over the Gulf of Tehuantepec on the Pacific coast. Chivela Pass is a gap between the Sierra Madre del Sur and the Sierra Madre range to the south.
Papagayo wind shrieks over the lakes of Nicaragua and pushes far out over the Gulf of Papagayo on the Pacific coast. The Cordillera Central Mountains rise to the south, gradually descending to Gatun Lake and the Isthmus of Panama.
Panama winds slice through to the Pacific through the Gaillard Cut in Panama, which also holds the Panama Canal.

Cause
The air flow is due to surges of cold dense air originating from the North American continent.
The meteorological mechanism that causes Tehuano and Papagayo winds is relatively simple. In the winter, cold high-pressure weather systems move southward from North America over the Gulf of Mexico. These high pressure systems create strong pressure gradients between the atmosphere over the Gulf of Mexico and the warmer, moister atmosphere over the Pacific Ocean. Just as a river flows from high elevations to lower elevations, the air in the high pressure system will flow ""downhill"" toward lower pressure, but the Cordillera mountains block the flow of air, channeling it through Chivela Pass in Mexico, the lake district of Nicaragua, and also Gaillard (Culebra) Cut in Panama. Many times, a Tehuano wind is followed by Papagayo and Panama winds a few days later as the high pressure system moves south.
The arrival of these cold surges, and their associated anticyclonic circulation, strengthens the trade winds at low latitudes, and this effect can last for several days. The wind flow over Central America is actually composed of the confluence of two air streams; one from the north, associated with cold surges, and the other from the northeast, associated with trade winds north of South America.

Local effects
The winds blow at speeds of 80 km/h or more down the hillsides from Chivela Pass and over the waters of the Gulf of Tehuantepec, sometimes extending more than 500 miles (800 km) into the Pacific Ocean. The surface waters under the Gulf of Tehuantepec wind jet can cool by as much as 10 °C in a day. In addition to the cold water that is detectable from other satellite sensors, the ocean's response to these winds shows up in satellite estimates of chlorophyll from ocean color measurements. The cold water and high chlorophyll concentration are signatures of mixing and upwelling of cold, nutrient-rich deep water. Fish converge on this food source, which supports the highly successful fishing industry in the Gulf of Tehuantepec.

Nucleation,"In thermodynamics, nucleation is the first step in the formation of either a new thermodynamic phase or structure via self-assembly or self-organization within a substance or mixture. Nucleation is typically defined to be the process that determines how long an observer has to wait before the new phase or self-organized structure appears. For example, if a volume of water is cooled (at atmospheric pressure) significantly below 0 °C, it will tend to freeze into ice, but volumes of water cooled only a few degrees below 0 °C often stay completely free of ice for long periods (supercooling). At these conditions, nucleation of ice is either slow or does not occur at all. However, at lower temperatures nucleation is fast, and ice crystals appear after little or no delay.
Nucleation is a common mechanism which generates first-order phase transitions, and it is the start of the process of forming a new thermodynamic phase. In contrast, new phases at continuous phase transitions start to form immediately.
Nucleation is often very sensitive to impurities in the system. These impurities may be too small to be seen by the naked eye, but still can control the rate of nucleation. Because of this, it is often important to distinguish between heterogeneous nucleation and homogeneous nucleation. Heterogeneous nucleation occurs at nucleation sites on surfaces in the system. Homogeneous nucleation occurs away from a surface.

Characteristics
Nucleation is usually a stochastic (random) process, so even in two identical systems nucleation will occur at different times. A common mechanism is illustrated in the animation to the right. This shows nucleation of a new phase (shown in red) in an existing phase (white). In the existing phase microscopic fluctuations of the red phase appear and decay continuously, until an unusually large fluctuation of the new red phase is so large it is more favourable for it to grow than to shrink back to nothing. This nucleus of the red phase then grows and converts the system to this phase. The standard theory that describes this behaviour for the nucleation of a new thermodynamic phase is called classical nucleation theory. However, the CNT fails in describing experimental results of vapour to liquid nucleation even for model substances like argon by several orders of magnitude.
For nucleation of a new thermodynamic phase, such as the formation of ice in water below 0 °C, if the system is not evolving with time and nucleation occurs in one step, then the probability that nucleation has not occurred should undergo exponential decay. This is seen for example in the nucleation of ice in supercooled small water droplets. The decay rate of the exponential gives the nucleation rate. Classical nucleation theory is a widely used approximate theory for estimating these rates, and how they vary with variables such as temperature. It correctly predicts that the time you have to wait for nucleation decreases extremely rapidly when supersaturated.
It is not just new phases such as liquids and crystals that form via nucleation followed by growth. The self-assembly process that forms objects like the amyloid aggregates associated with Alzheimer's disease also starts with nucleation. Energy consuming self-organising systems such as the microtubules in cells also show nucleation and growth.

Heterogeneous nucleation often dominates homogeneous nucleation
Heterogeneous nucleation, nucleation with the nucleus at a surface, is much more common than homogeneous nucleation. 
For example, in the nucleation of ice from supercooled water droplets, purifying the water to remove all or almost all impurities results in water droplets that freeze below around −35 °C, whereas water that contains impurities may freeze at −5 °C or warmer.
This observation that heterogeneous nucleation can occur when the rate of homogeneous nucleation is essentially zero, is often understood using classical nucleation theory. This predicts that the nucleation slows exponentially with the height of a free energy barrier ΔG*. This barrier comes from the free energy penalty of forming the surface of the growing nucleus. For homogeneous nucleation the nucleus is approximated by a sphere, but as we can see in the schematic of macroscopic droplets to the right, droplets on surfaces are not complete spheres and so the area of the interface between the droplet and the surrounding fluid is less than a sphere's

. This reduction in surface area of the nucleus reduces the height of the barrier to nucleation and so speeds nucleation up exponentially.
Nucleation can also start at the surface of a liquid. For example, computer simulations of gold nanoparticles show that the crystal phase sometimes nucleates at the liquid-gold surface.

Desert fungi,"The desert fungi are a variety of terricolous fungi inhabiting the biological soil crust of arid regions. Those exposed to the sun typically contain melanin and are resistant to high temperatures, dryness and low nutrition. Species that are common elsewhere (e.g. Penicillium spp. and common soil Aspergillus spp.) do not thrive in these conditions. Producing large dark unicellular spores also helps survival. Sexually reproducing ascomycetes, especially Chaetomium spp., have developed resilience by growing thick, dark perithecia. Under desert shrubs, however, more sensitive species such as Gymnoascus reesii prevail.

 form “neutral density surfaces”, which are closely aligned with the ""neutral tangent plane"".  It is widely believed, although this has yet to be rigorously proven, that the flow in the deep ocean is almost entirely aligned with the neutral tangent plane, and strong lateral mixing occurs along this plane (""epineutral mixing"") vs weak mixing across this plane (""dianeutral mixing"").
These surfaces are widely used in water mass analyses. Neutral density is a density variable that depends on the particular state of the ocean, and hence is also a function of time, though this is often ignored. In practice, its construction from a given hydrographic dataset is achieved by means of a computational code (available for Matlab and Fortran), that contains the computational algorithm developed by Jackett and McDougall. Use of this code is currently restricted to the present day ocean.

Mathematical expression
The neutral tangent plane is the plane along which a given water parcel can move infinitesimally while remaining neutrally buoyant with its immediate environment.  This is well-defined at every point in the ocean. 
A neutral surface is a surface that is everywhere parallel to the neutral tangent plane.
McDougall demonstrated that the neutral tangent plane, and hence also neutral surfaces, are normal to the dianeutral vector

Actinide chemistry,"Actinide chemistry (or actinoid chemistry) is one of the main branches of nuclear chemistry that investigates the processes and molecular systems of the actinides. The actinides derive their name from the group 3 element actinium. The informal chemical symbol An is used in general discussions of actinide chemistry to refer to any actinide. All but one of the actinides are f-block elements, corresponding to the filling of the 5f electron shell; lawrencium, a d-block element, is also generally considered an actinide. In comparison with the lanthanides, also mostly f-block elements, the actinides show much more variable valence. The actinide series encompasses the 15 metallic chemical elements with atomic numbers from 89 to 103, actinium through lawrencium.

Main branches
Organoactinide chemistry
In contrast to the relatively early flowering of organotransition-metal chemistry (1955 to the present), the corresponding development of actinide organometallic chemistry has taken place largely within the past 15 or so years. During this period, 5f organometallic science has blossomed, and it is now apparent that the actinides have a rich, intricate, and highly informative organometallic chemistry. Intriguing parallels to and sharp differences from the d-block elements have emerged. Actinides can coordinate the organic active groups or bind to carbon by the covalent bonds.

Thermodynamics of actinides
The necessity of obtaining accurate thermodynamic quantities for the actinide elements and their compounds was recognized at the outset of the Manhattan Project, when a dedicated team of scientists and engineers initiated the program to exploit nuclear energy for military purposes. Since the end of World War II, both fundamental and applied objectives have motivated a great deal of further study of actinide thermodynamics.

Nanotechnology and supramolecular chemistry of actinides
The possibility of using unique properties of lanthanides in the nanotechnology is demonstrated. The origination of linear and nonlinear optical properties of lanthanide compounds with phthalocyanines, porphyrins, naphthalocyanines, and their analogs in solutions and condensed state and the prospects of obtaining novel materials on their basis are discussed. Based on the electronic structure and properties of lanthanides and their compounds, namely, optical and magnetic characteristics, electronic and ionic conductivity, and fluctuating valence, molecular engines are classified. High-speed storage engines or memory storage engines; photoconversion molecular engines based on Ln(II) and Ln(III); electrochemical molecular engines involving silicate and phosphate glasses; molecular engines whose operation is based on insulator – semiconductor, semiconductor – metal, and metal – superconductor types of conductivity phase transitions; solid electrolyte molecular engines; and miniaturized molecular engines for medical analysis are distinguished. It is shown that thermodynamically stable nanoparticles of LnxMy composition can be formed by d elements of the second halves of the series, i.e., those arranged after M = Mn, Tc, and Re.

Biological and environmental chemistry of actinides
Generally, ingested insoluble actinide compounds such as high-fired uranium dioxide and mixed oxide (MOX) fuel will pass through the digestive system with little effect since they cannot dissolve and be absorbed by the body. Inhaled actinide compounds, however, will be more damaging as they remain in the lungs and irradiate the lung tissue. Ingested Low-fired oxides and soluble salts such as nitrate can be absorbed into the blood stream. If they are inhaled then it is possible for the solid to dissolve and leave the lungs. Hence the dose to the lungs will be lower for the soluble form.
Radon and radium are not actinides—they are both radioactive daughters from the decay of uranium. Aspects of their biology and environmental behaviour is discussed at radium in the environment.

In India, a large amount of thorium ore can be found in the form of monazite in placer deposits of the Western and Eastern coastal dune sands, particularly in the Tamil Nadu coastal areas. The residents of this area are exposed to a naturally occurring radiation dose ten times higher than the worldwide average.
Thorium has been linked to liver cancer. In the past thoria (thorium dioxide) was used as a contrast agent for medical X-ray radiography but its use has been discontinued. It was sold under the name Thorotrast.
Uranium is about as abundant as arsenic or molybdenum. Significant concentrations of uranium occur in some substances such as phosphate rock deposits, and minerals such as lignite, and monazite sands in uranium-rich ores (it is recovered commercially from these sources). 
Seawater contains about 3.3 parts per billion of uranium by weight as uranium(VI) forms soluble carbonate complexes. The extraction of uranium from seawater has been considered as a means of obtaining the element.

Desert ecology,"Desert ecology is the study of interactions between both biotic and abiotic components of desert environments. A desert ecosystem is defined by interactions between organisms, the climate in which they live, and any other non-living influences on the habitat. Deserts are arid regions that are generally associated with warm temperatures; however, cold deserts also exist. Deserts can be found in every continent, with the largest deserts located in Antarctica, the Arctic, Northern Africa, and the Middle East.

Climate
Deserts experience a wide range of temperatures and weather conditions, and can be classified into four types: hot, semiarid, coastal, and cold. Hot deserts experience warm temperatures year round, and low annual precipitation. Low levels of humidity in hot deserts contribute to high daytime temperatures, and extensive night time heat loss. The average annual temperature in hot deserts is approximately 20 to 25 °C, however, extreme weather conditions can lead to temperatures ranging from -18 to 49 °C.
Rainfall generally occurs, followed by long periods of dryness. Semiarid deserts experience similar conditions to hot deserts, however, the maximum and minimum temperatures tend to be less extreme, and generally range from 10 to 38 °C. Coastal deserts are cooler than hot and semiarid deserts, with average summer temperatures ranging between 13 and 24 °C. They also feature higher total rainfall values. Cold deserts are similar in temperature to coastal deserts, however, they receive more annual precipitation in the form of snowfall. Deserts are most notable for their dry climates; usually a result from their surrounding geography. For example, rain-blocking mountain ranges, and distance from oceans are two geographic features that contribute to desert aridity. Rain-blocking mountain ranges create Rain Shadows. As air rises and cools, its relative humidity increases and some or most moisture rains out, leaving little to no water vapor to form precipitation on the other side of the mountain range.

Deserts occupy one-fifth of the Earth's land surface and occur in two belts: between 15° and 35° latitude in both the southern and northern hemispheres. These bands are associated with the high solar intensities that all areas in the tropics receive, and with the dry air brought down by the descending arms of both the Hadley and Ferell atmospheric circulation cells. Dry winds hold little moisture for these areas, and also tend to evaporate any water present.
Many desert ecosystems are limited by available water levels, rather than rates of radiation or temperature. Water flow in these ecosystems can be thought of as similar to energy flow; in fact, it is often useful to look at water and energy flow together when studying desert ecosystems and ecology.
Water availability in deserts may also be hindered by loose sediments. Dust clouds commonly form in windy, arid climates. Scientists have previously theorised that desert dust clouds would enhance rainfall, however, some more recent studies have shown that precipitation is actually inhibited by this phenomenon by absorbing moisture from the atmosphere. This absorption of atmospheric moisture can result in a positive feedback loop, which leads to further desertification.

Landscape
Desert landscapes can contain a wide variety of geological features, such as oases, rock outcrops, dunes, and mountains. Dunes are structures formed by wind moving sediments into mounds. Desert dunes are generally classified based on their orientation relative to wind directly. Possibly the most recognizable dune type are transverse dunes, characterized by crests transverse to the wind direction. Many dunes are considered to be active, meaning that they can travel and change over time due to the influence of the wind. However, some dunes can be anchored in place by vegetation or topography, preventing their movement. Some dunes may also be referred to as sticky. These types of dunes occur when individual grains of sand become cemented together. Sticky dunes tend to be more stable, and resistant to wind reworking than loose dunes. Barchan, and Seif dunes are among the most common of desert dunes. Barchan dunes are formed as winds continuously blow in the same direction, and are characterized by a crescent-shape atop the dune. Seif dunes are long and narrow, featuring a sharp crest, and are more common in the Sahara Desert.
Analysis of geological features in desert environments can reveal a lot about the geologic history of the area. Through observation and identification of rock deposits, geologists are able to interpret the order of events that occurred during desert formation. For example, research conducted on the surface geology of the Namib Desert allowed geologists to interpret ancient movements of the Kuiseb River based on rock ages and features identified in the area.

Lost city,"A lost city is an urban settlement that fell into terminal decline and became extensively or completely uninhabited, with the consequence that the site's former significance was no longer known to the wider world. The locations of many lost cities have been forgotten, but some have been rediscovered and studied extensively by scientists. Recently abandoned cities or cities whose location was never in question might be referred to as ruins or ghost towns. Smaller settlements may be referred to as abandoned villages. The search for such lost cities by European explorers and adventurers in Africa, the Americas, and Southeast Asia from the 15th century onward eventually led to the development of archaeology.
Lost cities generally fall into two broad categories: those where all knowledge of the city's existence was forgotten before it was rediscovered, and those whose memory was preserved in myth, legend, or historical records but whose location was lost or at least no longer widely recognized.

How cities are lost
Cities may become lost for a variety of reasons including natural disasters, economic or social upheaval, or war.
The Incan capital city of Vilcabamba was destroyed and depopulated during the Spanish conquest of Peru in 1572. The Spanish did not rebuild the city, and the location went unrecorded and was forgotten until it was rediscovered through a detailed examination of period letters and documents.
Troy was a city located in northwest Anatolia in what is now Turkey. It is best known for being the focus of the Trojan War described in the Greek Epic Cycle and especially in the Iliad, one of the two epic poems attributed to Homer. Repeatedly destroyed and rebuilt, the city slowly declined and was abandoned in the Byzantine era. Buried by time, the city was consigned to the realm of legend until the location was first excavated in the 1860s.
Other settlements are lost with few or no clues to their abandonment. For example, Malden Island, in the central Pacific, was deserted when first visited by Europeans in 1825, but the remains of temples and other structures on the island indicate that a population of Polynesians had lived there for perhaps several generations in the past. Typically this lack of information is due to a lack of surviving written or oral histories and a lack of archaeological data as in the case of the remote and fairly unknown Malden Island.

Rediscovery
With the development of archaeology and the application of modern techniques, many previously lost cities have been rediscovered.
Machu Picchu is a pre-Columbian Inca site situated on a mountain ridge above the Urubamba Valley in Peru. Often referred to as the ""Lost City of the Incas"", it is perhaps the most familiar icon of the Inca World. Machu Picchu was built around 1450, at the height of the Inca Empire. It was abandoned just over 100 years later, in 1572, as a belated result of the Spanish Conquest. It is possible that most of its inhabitants died from smallpox introduced by travelers before the Spanish conquistadors arrived in the area. In 1911, Melchor Arteaga led the explorer Hiram Bingham to Machu Picchu, which had been largely forgotten by everybody except the small number of people living in the immediate valley. Nevertheless, Peruvian explorer and farmer Agustín Lizárraga predated this discovery by 9 years, having found the Inca site on July 14, 1902. He left a charcoal inscription bearing the words ""A. Lizárraga 1902"".
Helike was an ancient Greek city that sank at night in the winter of 373 BCE. The city was located in Achaea, Northern Peloponnesos, two kilometres (12 stadia) from the Corinthian Gulf. The city was thought to be legend until 2001, when it was rediscovered in the Helike Delta. In 1988, the Greek archaeologist Dora Katsonopoulou launched the Helike Project to locate the site of the lost city. In 1994, in collaboration with the University of Patras, a magnetometer survey was carried out in the midplain of the delta, which revealed the outlines of a buried building. In 1995, this target was excavated (now known as the Klonis site), and a large Roman building with standing walls was brought to light.

Atom,"Atoms are the basic particles of the chemical elements. An atom consists of a nucleus of protons and generally neutrons, surrounded by an electromagnetically bound swarm of electrons.  The chemical elements are distinguished from each other by the number of protons that are in their atoms. For example, any atom that contains 11 protons is sodium, and any atom that contains 29 protons is copper. Atoms with the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons are called isotopes of the same element.
Atoms are extremely small, typically around 100 picometers across. A human hair is about a million carbon atoms wide. Atoms are smaller than the shortest wavelength of visible light, which means humans cannot see atoms with conventional microscopes. They are so small that accurately predicting their behavior using classical physics is not possible due to quantum effects.
More than 99.9994% of an atom's mass is in the nucleus. Protons have a positive electric charge and neutrons have no charge, so the nucleus is positively charged. The electrons are negatively charged, and this opposing charge is what binds them to the nucleus. If the numbers of protons and electrons are equal, as they normally are, then the atom is electrically neutral as a whole. If an atom has more electrons than protons, then it has an overall negative charge and is called a negative ion (or anion). Conversely, if it has more protons than electrons, it has a positive charge and is called a positive ion (or cation).
The electrons of an atom are attracted to the protons in an atomic nucleus by the electromagnetic force. The protons and neutrons in the nucleus are attracted to each other by the nuclear force. This force is usually stronger than the electromagnetic force that repels the positively charged protons from one another. Under certain circumstances, the repelling electromagnetic force becomes stronger than the nuclear force. In this case, the nucleus splits and leaves behind different elements. This is a form of nuclear decay.
Atoms can attach to one or more other atoms by chemical bonds to form chemical compounds such as molecules or crystals. The ability of atoms to attach and detach from each other is responsible for most of the physical changes observed in nature. Chemistry is the science that studies these changes.

History of atomic theory
In philosophy
The basic idea that matter is made up of tiny indivisible particles is an old idea that appeared in many ancient cultures. The word atom is derived from the ancient Greek word atomos, which means ""uncuttable"". But this ancient idea was based in philosophical reasoning rather than scientific reasoning. Modern atomic theory is not based on these old concepts. In the early 19th century, the scientist John Dalton found evidence that matter really is composed of discrete units, and so applied the word atom to those units.

Dalton's law of multiple proportions
In the early 1800s, John Dalton compiled experimental data gathered by him and other scientists and discovered a pattern now known as the ""law of multiple proportions"". He noticed that in any group of chemical compounds which all contain two particular chemical elements, the amount of Element A per measure of Element B will differ across these compounds by ratios of small whole numbers. This pattern suggested that each element combines with other elements in multiples of a basic unit of weight, with each element having a unit of unique weight. Dalton decided to call these units ""atoms"".
For example, there are two types of tin oxide: one is a grey powder that is 88.1% tin and 11.9% oxygen, and the other is a white powder that is 78.7% tin and 21.3% oxygen. Adjusting these figures, in the grey powder there is about 13.5 g of oxygen for every 100 g of tin, and in the white powder there is about 27 g of oxygen for every 100 g of tin. 13.5 and 27 form a ratio of 1:2. Dalton concluded that in the grey oxide there is one atom of oxygen for every atom of tin, and in the white oxide there are two atoms of oxygen for every atom of tin (SnO and SnO2).
Dalton also analyzed iron oxides. There is one type of iron oxide that is a black powder which is 78.1% iron and 21.9% oxygen; and there is another iron oxide that is a red powder which is 70.4% iron and 29.6% oxygen. Adjusting these figures, in the black powder there is about 28 g of oxygen for every 100 g of iron, and in the red powder there is about 42 g of oxygen for every 100 g of iron. 28 and 42 form a ratio of 2:3. Dalton concluded that in these oxides, for every two atoms of iron, there are two or three atoms of oxygen respectively. These substances are known today as iron(II) oxide and iron(III) oxide, and their formulas are FeO and Fe2O3 respectively. Iron(II) oxide's formula is normally written as FeO, but since it is a crystalline substance we could alternately write it as Fe2O2, and when we contrast that with Fe2O3, the 2:3 ratio for the oxygen is plain to see.

Lisbon Principles,"In 1997, a core set of six principles was established by ecological economist Robert Costanza for the sustainability governance of the oceans. These six principles became known as the ""Lisbon Principles"": together they provide basic guidelines for administering the use of common natural and social resources.

Principle 1: Responsibility. Access to environmental resources carries attendant responsibilities to use them in an ecologically sustainable, economically efficient, and socially fair manner. Individual and corporate responsibilities and incentives should be aligned with each other and with broad social and ecological goals.
Principle 2: Scale-matching. Ecological problems are rarely confined to a single scale. Decision-making on environmental resources should (i) be assigned to institutional levels that maximize ecological input, (ii) ensure the flow of ecological information between institutional levels, (iii) take ownership and actors into account, and (iv) internalize costs and benefits. Appropriate scales of governance will be those that have the most relevant information, can respond quickly and efficiently, and are able to integrate across scale boundaries.
Principle 3: Precaution. In the face of uncertainty about potentially irreversible environmental impacts, decisions concerning their use should err on the side of caution. The burden of proof should shift to those whose activities potentially damage the environment.
Principle 4: Adaptive management. Given that some level of uncertainty always exists in environmental resource management, decision-makers should continuously gather and integrate appropriate ecological, social, and economic information with the goal of adaptive improvement.
Principle 5: Full cost allocation. All of the internal and external costs and benefits, including social and ecological, of alternative decisions concerning the use of environmental resources should be identified and allocated. When appropriate, markets should be adjusted to reflect full costs.
Principle 6: Participation. All stakeholders should be engaged in the formulation and implementation of decisions concerning environmental resources. Full stakeholder awareness and participation contributes to credible, accepted rules that identify and assign the corresponding responsibilities appropriately.

Land and water hemispheres,"The land hemisphere and water hemisphere are the hemispheres of Earth containing the largest possible total areas of land and ocean, respectively. By definition (assuming that the entire surface can be classified as either ""land"" or ""ocean""), the two hemispheres do not overlap.
Determinations of the hemispheres vary slightly. One determination places the centre of the land hemisphere at 47°13′N 1°32′W (in the city of Nantes, France). The centre of the water hemisphere is the antipode of the centre of the land hemisphere, and is therefore located at 47°13′S 178°28′E (near New Zealand's Bounty Islands in the Pacific Ocean).
An alternative assignment determines the centre of the land hemisphere to be at 47°24′42″N 2°37′15″W (in Île Dumet near Piriac-sur-Mer, France). The centre of the sea hemisphere is located at 47°24′42″S 177°22′45″E (near New Zealand's Bounty Islands in the Pacific Ocean).

Distribution of geographical features
The land hemisphere has the substantial majority of the planet's land (80.1 percent), including nearly all of Asia (with Maritime Southeast Asia being the only notable exception) and most of South America. Africa, Europe, and North America are solely within the land hemisphere. However, even in the land hemisphere, the water area still slightly exceeds the land area (with 53 percent water to 47 percent land). This hemisphere is almost identical to the hemisphere containing the greatest human population. The land hemisphere also contains most of Earth's inland waters, including the African Great Lakes, Eurasia's Caspian Sea, the Great Lakes of North America, and Lake Baikal in Siberia.
The water hemisphere has only about one-fifth of the world's land, including Easter Island, the Hawaiian Islands, other Pacific islands, Maritime Southeast Asia, the southern tip of the Indochinese Peninsula, the southern portion of the Malay Peninsula, the Ryukyu Islands, Taiwan, and the Southern Cone of the Americas. Antarctica, Australia, and Zealandia are solely within the water hemisphere. Some sources further divide land into ""dry land"" and ""ice cap"". Antarctica provides the water hemisphere with the majority of Earth's ice.
Most of the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean, and the whole Southern Ocean, are in the water hemisphere. The water hemisphere is approximately 89 percent water (almost all pertaining to the World Ocean), 6 percent dry land and 5 percent polar ice cap.
The table below shows Alphonse Berget's estimates of the land area in each continent in the land and water hemispheres.

Borders of the oceans,"The borders of the oceans are the limits of Earth's oceanic waters. The definition and number of oceans can vary depending on the adopted criteria. The principal divisions (in descending order of area) of the five oceans are the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Southern (Antarctic) Ocean, and Arctic Ocean. Smaller regions of the oceans are called seas, gulfs, bays, straits, and other terms. Geologically, an ocean is an area of oceanic crust covered by water.
See also: List of seas on Earth for the seas included in each oceanic area.

Overview
Though generally described as several separate oceans, the world's oceanic waters constitute one global, interconnected body of salt water sometimes referred to as the World Ocean or  Global Ocean. This concept of a continuous body of water with relatively free interchange among its parts is of fundamental importance to oceanography.
The major oceanic divisions are defined in part by the continents, various archipelagos, and other criteria. The principal divisions (in descending order of area) are the: Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Southern (Antarctic) Ocean, and Arctic Ocean. Smaller regions of the oceans are called seas, gulfs, bays, straits, and other terms.
Geologically, an ocean is an area of oceanic crust covered by water. Oceanic crust is the thin layer of solidified volcanic basalt that covers the Earth's mantle. Continental crust is thicker but less dense. From this perspective, the Earth has three oceans: the World Ocean, the Caspian Sea, and the Black Sea. The latter two were formed by the collision of Cimmeria with Laurasia. The Mediterranean Sea is at times a discrete ocean because tectonic plate movement has repeatedly broken its connection to the World Ocean through the Strait of Gibraltar. The Black Sea is connected to the Mediterranean through the Bosporus, but the Bosporus is a natural canal cut through continental rock some 7,000 years ago, rather than a piece of oceanic sea floor like the Strait of Gibraltar.
Despite their names, some smaller landlocked ""seas"" are not connected with the World Ocean, such as the Caspian Sea (which is nevertheless, geologically, itself a full-fledged ocean—see above) and numerous salt lakes such as the Aral Sea.
A complete hierarchy showing which seas belong to which oceans, according to the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO), is available at the European Marine Gazetteer website. See also the list of seas article for the seas included in each ocean area. Also note there are many varying definitions of the world's seas and no single authority.

List of oceans
The world ocean is divided into a number of principal oceanic areas that are delimited by the continents and various oceanographic features: these divisions are the Atlantic Ocean, Arctic Ocean (sometimes considered an estuary of the Atlantic), Indian Ocean, Pacific Ocean, and the Southern Ocean, defined by the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) in 2000, the latter being a relatively new addition identified with a distinct ecosystem and a unique impact on global climate. In turn, oceanic waters are interspersed by many smaller seas, gulfs, and bays.
If viewed from the southern pole of Earth, the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans can be seen as lobes extending northward from the Southern Ocean. Farther north, the Atlantic opens into the Arctic Ocean, which is connected to the Pacific by the Bering Strait, forming a continuous expanse of water.
The five oceans are:

The Pacific Ocean, the largest of the oceans, also reaches northward from the Southern Ocean to the Arctic Ocean. It spans the gap between Australia and Asia, and the Americas. The Pacific Ocean meets the Atlantic Ocean south of South America at Cape Horn.
The Atlantic Ocean, the second largest, extends from the Southern Ocean between the Americas, and Africa and Europe, to the Arctic Ocean. The Atlantic Ocean meets the Indian Ocean south of Africa at Cape Agulhas.
The Indian Ocean, the third largest, extends northward from the Southern Ocean to India, the Arabian Peninsula, and Southeast Asia in Asia, and between Africa in the west and Australia in the east. The Indian Ocean joins the Pacific Ocean to the east, near Australia at South East Cape.
The Arctic Ocean is the smallest of the five. It joins the Atlantic Ocean near Greenland and Iceland and joins the Pacific Ocean at the Bering Strait. It overlies the North Pole, touching North America in the Western Hemisphere and Scandinavia and Siberia in the Eastern Hemisphere. The Arctic Ocean is partially covered in sea ice, the extent of which varies according to the season.
The Southern Ocean is a proposed ocean surrounding Antarctica, dominated by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, generally the ocean south of 60 degrees south latitude. The Southern Ocean is partially covered in sea ice, the extent of which varies according to the season. The Southern Ocean is the second smallest of the five named oce",Oceans,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borders_of_the_oceans,1,border ocean limit earth oceanic water definition number ocean vary depending adopted criterion principal division descending order area five ocean pacific ocean atlantic ocean indian ocean southern antarctic ocean arctic ocean smaller region ocean called sea gulf bay strait term geologically ocean area oceanic crust covered water see also list sea earth sea included oceanic area overview though generally described several separate ocean world oceanic water constitute one global interconnected body salt water sometimes referred world ocean global ocean concept continuous body water relatively free interchange among part fundamental importance oceanography major oceanic division defined part continent various archipelago criterion principal division descending order area pacific ocean atlantic ocean indian ocean southern antarctic ocean arctic ocean smaller region ocean called sea gulf bay strait term geologically ocean area oceanic crust covered water oceanic crust thin layer solidified volcanic basalt cover earth mantle continental crust thicker less dense perspective earth three ocean world ocean caspian sea black sea latter two formed collision cimmeria laurasia mediterranean sea time discrete ocean tectonic plate movement repeatedly broken connection world ocean strait gibraltar black sea connected mediterranean bosporus bosporus natural canal cut continental rock year ago rather piece oceanic sea floor like strait gibraltar despite name smaller landlocked sea connected world ocean caspian sea nevertheless geologically fullfledged ocean—see numerous salt lake aral sea complete hierarchy showing sea belong ocean according international hydrographic organization iho available european marine gazetteer website see also list sea article sea included ocean area also note many varying definition world sea single authority list ocean world ocean divided number principal oceanic area delimited continent various oceanographic feature division atlantic ocean arctic ocean sometimes considered estuary atlantic indian ocean pacific ocean southern ocean defined international hydrographic organization iho latter relatively new addition identified distinct ecosystem unique impact global climate turn oceanic water interspersed many smaller sea gulf bay viewed southern pole earth atlantic indian pacific ocean seen lobe extending northward southern ocean farther north atlantic open arctic ocean connected pacific bering strait forming continuous expanse water five ocean pacific ocean largest ocean also reach northward southern ocean arctic ocean span gap australia asia america pacific ocean meet atlantic ocean south south america cape horn atlantic ocean second largest extends southern ocean america africa europe arctic ocean atlantic ocean meet indian ocean south africa cape agulhas indian ocean third largest extends northward southern ocean india arabian peninsula southeast asia asia africa west australia east indian ocean join pacific ocean east near australia south east cape arctic ocean smallest five join atlantic ocean near greenland iceland join pacific ocean bering strait overlies north pole touching north america western hemisphere scandinavia siberia eastern hemisphere arctic ocean partially covered sea ice extent varies according season southern ocean proposed ocean surrounding antarctica dominated antarctic circumpolar current generally ocean south degree south latitude southern ocean partially covered sea ice extent varies according season southern ocean second smallest five named oce
City centre,"A city centre, also known as an urban core, is the commercial, cultural and often the historical, political, and geographic heart of a city. The term ""city centre"" is primarily used in British English, and closely equivalent terms that exist in other languages, such as ""centre-ville"" in French, Stadtzentrum in German, or shìzhōngxīn (市中心) in Chinese. In the United States, the term ""downtown"" is generally used, though a few cities, like Philadelphia, use the term ""Center City"" or ""City Center"".

Overview and related concepts
The city centre is the (often historical) area of a city where commerce, entertainment, shopping, and political power are concentrated. The term is commonly used in many English-speaking countries and has direct equivalents in many other languages. However, noticeably, in the United States, the term ""downtown"" is commonly used to denote a city centre, and in Canada the terms ""city centre"" and ""downtown"" are used interchangeably, most notable in the modern, purpose-built cores of former boroughs or newer suburban cities that had no traditional urban core (i.e. North York City Centre and Mississauga City Centre). In Australia, the term ""Central Business District"" is widely used to refer to the city centre, but usage of the term ""City Centre"" is increasing, especially in Melbourne. In South Africa, ""CBD"" is used in formal contexts, but in informal contexts, the city centre is referred to as ""town"", and despite the growth of decentralised CBDs such as Sandton and uMhlanga ""town"" continues to refer to the original CBDs of cities.
In many cities, the Central Business District (CBD) is within the city centre, but the concept ""city centre"" differs from the CBD. The concept of the ""CBD"" revolves solely around economic and financial power, but the ""city centre"" also includes historical, political, and cultural factors. A clear example is Paris: La Défense is the central business district of Paris, but it is not the city centre. In most larger and/or older cities, the CBD and the city centre will only partially overlap, if at all.
A city centre is often the first settled part of a city, which can make it the most historical part of a city: in such cases, it may be known as the ""old town"" (sometimes capitalized as a proper name).

Usage
Australia
In most Australian cities, the city centre to some extent coincides with the central business district, with the result that ""the City"", ""city centre"", and ""central business district"" or ""CBD"" are regarded as near-synonyms. However, in some Australian cities, the city centre and the CBD are geographically separately identified. The term ""CBD"" is not often used in the capital Canberra, where the primary activity is government; its ""city centre"" is usually identified as the district called ""City"" or ""Civic"".

China
In Chinese, the urban centre of a city is called the ""city centre"" or ""urban core"" (Chinese: 市中心; pinyin: shì zhōngxīn). In many cities, it is the historical city centre and the cultural and commercial centre. Historically, the CBD often occupied one portion of the city centre. In recent years, larger cities have often developed CBDs or financial districts that occupy a part of the city centre or are outside the historical city centre completely. For example, Beijing's historical city centre is defined by the former city walls and remains the political and cultural centre of the city, but Beijing's CBD sits in Chaoyang District, to the east of the historical city; Shanghai's city centre was defined by the Old Chinese City, the International Settlement and the French Concession and sat on the west bank of the Huangpu River, whereas the modern financial district is concentrated on Lujiazui, a newly developed area across the river from the traditional city centre (although parts of the traditional city centre remain key financial and business centres).

Israel
The Hebrew term for ""city centre"" is a direct translation: ""מרכז העיר"" (merkaz ha'ir); however it is used inconsistently in different cities throughout Israel due to their extremely varied topographies and urban designs.

In Jerusalem the term is used both colloquially and officially as the name of the commercial district that lies at the geographical center of the Western city. This area is many times larger, denser and more active than any of the city's other commercial centres. The formation of a dedicated city centre resulted partially from geographical necessity; pedestrian travel between different neighborhoods is difficult due to the hilly terrain, so public transportation and wider roadways instead pull residents to one centralized location - atop the city's central ridge-line - where they can congregate effectively. At the edges of the district the urban make-up shifts almost abruptly into residential neighborhoods, creating palpable boundaries. Much-smaller commercial centres within each residential neighborhood may meet day-to-day shopping needs, but mostly attract only local resident",Cities,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_centre,1,city centre also known urban core commercial cultural often historical political geographic heart city term city centre primarily used british english closely equivalent term exist language centreville french stadtzentrum german shìzhōngxīn 市中心 chinese united state term downtown generally used though city like philadelphia use term center city city center overview related concept city centre often historical area city commerce entertainment shopping political power concentrated term commonly used many englishspeaking country direct equivalent many language however noticeably united state term downtown commonly used denote city centre canada term city centre downtown used interchangeably notable modern purposebuilt core former borough newer suburban city traditional urban core ie north york city centre mississauga city centre australia term central business district widely used refer city centre usage term city centre increasing especially melbourne south africa cbd used formal context informal context city centre referred town despite growth decentralised cbds sandton umhlanga town continues refer original cbds city many city central business district cbd within city centre concept city centre differs cbd concept cbd revolves solely around economic financial power city centre also includes historical political cultural factor clear example paris la défense central business district paris city centre larger andor older city cbd city centre partially overlap city centre often first settled part city make historical part city case may known old town sometimes capitalized proper name usage australia australian city city centre extent coincides central business district result city city centre central business district cbd regarded nearsynonyms however australian city city centre cbd geographically separately identified term cbd often used capital canberra primary activity government city centre usually identified district called city civic china chinese urban centre city called city centre urban core chinese 市中心 pinyin shì zhōngxīn many city historical city centre cultural commercial centre historically cbd often occupied one portion city centre recent year larger city often developed cbds financial district occupy part city centre outside historical city centre completely example beijing historical city centre defined former city wall remains political cultural centre city beijing cbd sits chaoyang district east historical city shanghai city centre defined old chinese city international settlement french concession sat west bank huangpu river whereas modern financial district concentrated lujiazui newly developed area across river traditional city centre although part traditional city centre remain key financial business centre israel hebrew term city centre direct translation מרכז העיר merkaz hair however used inconsistently different city throughout israel due extremely varied topography urban design jerusalem term used colloquially officially name commercial district lie geographical center western city area many time larger denser active city commercial centre formation dedicated city centre resulted partially geographical necessity pedestrian travel different neighborhood difficult due hilly terrain public transportation wider roadway instead pull resident one centralized location atop city central ridgeline congregate effectively edge district urban makeup shift almost abruptly residential neighborhood creating palpable boundary muchsmaller commercial centre within residential neighborhood may meet daytoday shopping need mostly attract local resident
Literary dunce,"Dunce is a mild insult in English meaning ""a person who is slow at learning or stupid"". The etymology given by Richard Stanyhurst is that the word is derived from the name of the Scottish scholastic theologian and philosopher John Duns Scotus.

Dunce cap
A dunce cap, also variously known as a dunce hat, dunce's cap or dunce's hat, is a pointed hat, formerly used as an article of discipline in schools in Europe and the United States—especially in the 19th and early 20th centuries—for children who were disruptive or were considered slow in learning. In the 19th century, it was seen by some as degrading: in 1831, children's book author Sidney Babcock wrote of the dunce cap as debasing and harsh, and in 1899, historian Alice Morse Earle compared it to other forms of school discipline she saw as degrading and outdated. It became unpopular in the early 20th century. However, some North American schools still permitted caps as late as the 1950s. In modern pedagogy, punishments like dunce caps have fallen out of favor: By 1927 an editorial in the Educational Research Bulletin stated: ""The rod and the cap were not eminently successful ... we have our doubts about exclusion being the solution to the problem. ... High scholarship is not produced by students who have their curiosity stifled by their teachers. Curiosity must be stimulated if scholarship is desired, and sympathy is essential to this stimulation.""
The Oxford English Dictionary (3rd edition) cites mid-16th century examples of the term dunce used to describe a follower of Duns Scotus, a person engaged in ridiculous pedantry, or a person regarded as a ""fool"" or ""dimwit"". A visual depiction of the hat was first shown in the 1727 edition of The New England Primer, and the term dunce's cap is recorded as early as 1791. The first use of the term in literature was in 1840, in Charles Dickens' The Old Curiosity Shop. Scotus apparently believed that the hat would funnel knowledge into the brain, and in the centuries before his followers became unpopular, was a social signal of an intelligent person.
The dunce cap has also been connected with donkeys to portray the student as asinine. An engraving featured in an early 1900s textbook depicts a child sitting on a wooden donkey in an ""eighteenth-century"" classroom, wearing a dunce cap with donkey ears.
A similar cap made of paper and called a capirote was prescribed for sinners and penitents during the Spanish Inquisition.

Chott,"In geology, a chott, shott, or shatt (; Arabic: شط, romanized: šaṭṭ, lit. 'bank, coast') is a salt lake in Africa's Maghreb that stays dry for much of the year but receives some water in the winter.  The elevation of a chott surface is controlled by the position of the water table and capillary fringe, with sediment deflation occurring when the water table falls and sediment accumulation occurring when the water table rises. They are formed—within variable shores—by the spring thaw from the Atlas mountain range, along with occasional rainwater or groundwater sources in the Sahara, such as the Bas Saharan Basin.

Water sources
The chotts of the Sahara are fed intermittently during periods of infrequent rainfall. They are subject to a high evaporation rate, hence salts eventually accumulate in the surface of the sediment. In fact, annual evaporation rates per year in chotts often exceed 20 times the annual precipitation rate. This salt accumulation can lead chotts to have particularly high albedo, albeit with comparable variability as well. While evaporite deposition predominates on chotts, in more humid climatic periods, layers of mud can be deposited on the chott surface. When near a source of loose sand, aeolian deposition can also play a role in the sedimentary deposition on the chott surface.

Sahara Sea
As many lie below sea level, the chotts of the Sahara were viewed by some European colonialists and engineers as an opportunity to create an inland sea in the Sahara Desert (known by many as the ""Sahara Sea"") by cutting a canal to the Mediterranean Sea (or in some cases, the Atlantic Ocean). Such a channel would allow water from the sea to flow inland. The hope was that this would facilitate trade and naval warfare, as well as change the climatic conditions of the Sahara.

Analogue to Martian landforms
Chotts have also been studied because they are believed to be an Earth analogue to similar features on the planet Mars. Although there are considerable differences between terrestrial and Martian geology, some features on Mars are also believed to be evaporite basins, and consequently share at least some features of chotts. One example of a suspected Martian evaporite basin is Holden Crater.

Four continents,"Europeans in the 16th century divided the world into four continents: Africa, America, Asia, and Europe. Each of the four continents was seen to represent its quadrant of the world—Africa in the south, America in the west, Asia in the east, and Europe in the north. This division fit the Renaissance sensibilities of the time, which also divided the world into four seasons, four classical elements, four cardinal directions, four classical virtues, etc.
The four parts of the world or the four corners of the world refers to Africa (the ""south""), America (the ""west""), Asia (the ""east""), and Europe (the ""north"").
Depictions of personifications of the four continents became popular in several media. Sets of four could be placed around all sorts of four-sided objects, or in pairs along the façade of a building with a central doorway. They were common subjects for prints, and later small porcelain figures.  A set of loose conventions quickly arose as to the iconography of the figures. They were normally female, with Europe queenly and grandly dressed, Asia fully dressed but in an exotic style, with Africa and America at most half-dressed, and given exotic props as attributes.

A three-cornered world
Before the discovery of the New World a commonplace of classical and medieval geography had been the ""three parts"" in which, from Mediterranean and European perspectives, the world was divided: Europe, Asia and Africa. As Laurent de Premierfait, the pre-eminent French translator of Latin literature in the early fifteenth century, informed his readers:

Asia is one of the three parts of the world, which the authors divide in Asia, Africa and Europe. Asia extends towards the Orient as far as the rising sun (""devers le souleil levant""), towards the south (""midi"") it ends at the great sea, towards the occident it ends at our sea, and towards the north (""septentrion"") it ends in the Maeotian marshes and the river named Thanaus.

A fourth corner: the enlarged world
For Laurent's French readers, Asia ended at ""our sea"", the Mediterranean; Western Europeans were only dimly aware of the Ural Mountains, which divide Europe from Asia in the eyes of the modern geographer, and which represent the geological suture between two fragmentary continents, or cratons. Instead, the division between these continents in the European-centered picture was the Hellespont, which neatly separated Europe from Asia. From the European perspective, into the Age of Discovery, Asia began beyond the Hellespont with Asia Minor, where the Roman province of Asia had lain, and stretched away to what were initially unimaginably exotic and distant places— ""the Orient"".

Iconography
Cesare Ripa's Iconologia
In 1593, Cesare Ripa published one of the most successful emblem books for the use of artists and artisans who might be called upon to depict allegorical figures. He covered an astonishingly wide variety of fields, and his work was reprinted many times, though the text did not always correlate to the illustration. The book was still being brought up-to-date in the 18th century.  Ripa's text and the many sets of illustrations by various artists for different later editions (beginning in 1603) took some of the existing iconological conventions for the four continents, and were so influential that depictions for the next two centuries were largely determined by them.
Europa is depicted as a woman dressed in fine clothes. She wears a crown while the papal tiara and crowns of kings lie at her feet, indicating her position of power over all the continents. The plentiful cornucopia shows Europe to be a land of abundance and the small temple she holds signifies Christianity. As a continent of great military force, Europe is also accompanied by a horse and an array of weapons.  This probably draws on the Europa regina map schematic.
Africa, by contrast wears the elephant headdress and is accompanied by animals common to Africa such as a lion, the scorpion of the desert sands, and Cleopatra's asps.  These depictions come straight from Roman coins with personifications of the Roman province of Africa, a much smaller strip of the Mediterranean coast.  The abundance and fertility of Africa is symbolized in the cornucopia that she holds. Other personifications of Africa at the time depict her nude, symbolizing the Eurocentric perceptions of Africa as an uncivilized land. While the illustration of Africa in Ripa's Iconologia is light-skinned, it was also common to illustrate her with dark skin.
Ripa's Asia, seen by Europe as a continent of exotic spices, silk, and the seat of Religion, wears rich clothing and carries a smoking censer. The continent's warm climate is represented by the wreath of flowers in her hair. A camel takes its ease beside her.
The iconic image of America shows a Native American maiden in a feathered headdress, with bow and arrow. Perhaps she represents a fabled Amazon from the river that already carried the name.

Destination painting,"A destination painting or bucket list painting is a painting that in itself may inspire cultural tourism to a museum or other destination. Often such a work would be considered a ""masterpiece"". A more general characterization would be destination art.

Role in museums
Collections may adopt a policy to keep a destination painting permanently on location, where visitors can expect to see it, by preventing any loan to a travelling exhibition. They may also compete to acquire a potential destination painting during an art auction.
Such paintings can lead to overtourism in parts of a museum where the work is displayed, leading to challenges in exhibit design. This overcrowding can be exacerbated by modern social media photography. The tendency toward a crowded quick experience for major works has had a reaction in the more contemplative ""slow art"" movement.

Limnology,"Limnology ( lim-NOL-ə-jee; from Ancient Greek  λίμνη (límnē) 'lake' and  -λογία (-logía) 'study of') is the study of inland aquatic ecosystems. 
It includes aspects of the biological, chemical, physical, and geological characteristics of fresh and saline, natural and man-made bodies of water. This includes the study of lakes, reservoirs, ponds, rivers, springs, streams, wetlands, and groundwater. Water systems are often categorized as either running (lotic) or standing (lentic).
Limnology includes the study of the drainage basin, movement of water through the basin and biogeochemical changes that occur en route. A more recent sub-discipline of limnology, termed landscape limnology, studies, manages, and seeks to conserve these ecosystems using a landscape perspective, by explicitly examining connections between an aquatic ecosystem and its drainage basin. Recently, the need to understand global inland waters as part of the Earth system created a sub-discipline called global limnology. This approach considers processes in inland waters on a global scale, like the role of inland aquatic ecosystems in global biogeochemical cycles.
Limnology is closely related to aquatic ecology and hydrobiology, which study aquatic organisms and their interactions with the abiotic (non-living) environment. While limnology has substantial overlap with freshwater-focused disciplines (e.g., freshwater biology), it also includes the study of inland salt lakes.

History
The term limnology was coined by François-Alphonse Forel (1841–1912) who established the field with his studies of Lake Geneva. Interest in the discipline rapidly expanded, and in 1922 August Thienemann (a German zoologist) and Einar Naumann (a Swedish botanist) co-founded the International Society of Limnology (SIL, from Societas Internationalis Limnologiae).  Forel's original definition of limnology, ""the oceanography of lakes"", was expanded to encompass the study of all inland waters, and influenced Benedykt Dybowski's work on Lake Baikal.
Prominent early American limnologists included G. Evelyn Hutchinson and Ed Deevey. At the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Edward A. Birge, Chancey Juday, Charles R. Goldman, and Arthur D. Hasler contributed to the development of the Center for Limnology.

General limnology
Physical properties
Physical properties of aquatic ecosystems are determined by a combination of heat, currents, waves and other seasonal distributions of environmental conditions. The morphometry of a body of water depends on the type of feature (such as a lake, river, stream, wetland, estuary etc.) and the structure of the earth surrounding the body of water. Lakes, for instance, are classified by their formation, and zones of lakes are defined by water depth. River and stream system morphometry is driven by underlying geology of the area as well as the general velocity of the water.  Stream morphometry is also influenced by topography (especially slope) as well as precipitation patterns and other factors such as vegetation and land development. Connectivity between streams and lakes relates to the landscape drainage density, lake surface area and lake shape. 
Other types of aquatic systems which fall within the study of limnology are estuaries. Estuaries are bodies of water classified by the interaction of a river and the ocean or sea. Wetlands vary in size, shape, and pattern however the most common types, marshes, bogs and swamps, often fluctuate between containing shallow, freshwater and being dry depending on the time of year. The volume and quality of water in underground aquifers rely on the vegetation cover, which fosters recharge and aids in maintaining water quality.

Light interactions
Light zonation is the concept of how the amount of sunlight penetration into water influences the structure of a body of water. These zones define various levels of productivity within an aquatic ecosystems such as a lake. For instance, the depth of the water column which sunlight is able to penetrate and where most plant life is able to grow is known as the photic or euphotic zone. The rest of the water column which is deeper and does not receive sufficient amounts of sunlight for plant growth is known as the aphotic zone. The amount of solar energy present underwater and the spectral quality of the light that are present at various depths have a significant impact on the behavior of many aquatic organisms. For example, zooplankton's vertical migration is influenced by solar energy levels.

Thermal stratification
Similar to light zonation, thermal stratification or thermal zonation is a way of grouping parts of the water body within an aquatic system based on the temperature of different lake layers. The less turbid the water, the more light is able to penetrate, and thus heat is conveyed deeper in the water. Heating declines exponentially with depth in the water column, so the water will be warmest near the surface but progressively cooler as moving downwards.

Outline of philosophy,"Philosophy is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. It is distinguished from other ways of addressing fundamental questions (such as mysticism, myth) by being critical and generally systematic and by its reliance on rational argument. It involves logical analysis of language and clarification of the meaning of words and concepts.
The word ""philosophy"" comes from the Greek philosophia (φιλοσοφία), which literally means ""love of wisdom"".

Branches of philosophy

Confluence,"In geography, a confluence (also conflux) occurs where two or more watercourses join to form a single channel. A confluence can occur in several configurations: at the point where a tributary joins a larger river (main stem); or where two streams meet to become the source of a river of a new name (such as the confluence of the Monongahela and Allegheny rivers, forming the Ohio River); or where two separated channels of a river (forming a river island) rejoin downstream from their point of separation.

Scientific study
Confluences are studied in a variety of sciences. Hydrology studies the characteristic flow patterns of confluences and how they give rise to patterns of erosion, bars, and scour pools. The water flows and their consequences are often studied with mathematical models. Confluences are relevant to the distribution of living organisms (i.e., ecology) as well; ""the general pattern [downstream of confluences] of increasing stream flow and decreasing slopes drives a corresponding shift in habitat characteristics.""
Another science relevant to the study of confluences is chemistry, because sometimes the mixing of the waters of two streams triggers a chemical reaction, particularly in a polluted stream. The United States Geological Survey gives an example:  ""chemical changes occur when a stream contaminated with acid mine drainage combines with a stream with near-neutral pH water; these reactions happen very rapidly and influence the subsequent transport of metals downstream of the mixing zone.""
A natural phenomenon at confluences that is obvious even to casual observers is a difference in color between the two streams; see images in this article for several examples. According to Lynch, ""the color of each river is determined by many things: type and amount of vegetation in the watershed, geological properties, dissolved chemicals, sediments and biologic content – usually algae."" Lynch also notes that color differences can persist for miles downstream before they finally blend completely.

Flow zones
Hydrodynamic behaviour of flow in a confluence can be divided into six distinct features which are commonly called confluence flow zones (CFZ). These include

Stagnation zone
Flow deflection zone
Flow separation zone / recirculation zone
Maximum velocity zone
Flow recovery zone
Shear layers

Engineering
The broader field of engineering encompasses a vast assortment of subjects which concern confluences.
In hydraulic civil engineering, where two or more underground culverted / artificially buried watercourses intersect, great attention should be paid to the hydrodynamic aspects of the system to ensure the longevity and efficiency of the structure.
Engineers must design these systems with consideration of factors that ensure the discharge point is structurally stable as the entrance of the lateral culvert into the main structure may compromise the stability of the structure due to the lack of support at the discharge; this often constitutes additional supports in the form of structural bracing. The velocities and hydraulic efficiencies should be meticulously calculated and can be altered by integrating different combinations of geometries, components such a gradients, cascades and an adequate junction angle which is sympathetic to the direction of the watercourse’s flow to minimise turbulent flow, maximise evacuation velocity and to ultimately maximise hydraulic efficiency.

Cultural and societal significance
Since rivers often serve as political boundaries, confluences sometimes demarcate three abutting polities, such as nations, states, or provinces, forming a tripoint. Various examples are listed below.
Many major cities, such as Chongqing, St. Louis, and Khartoum,  arose at confluences; further examples appear in the list. Within a city, a confluence often forms a visually prominent point, so that confluences are sometimes chosen as the site of prominent public buildings or monuments, as in Koblenz, Lyon, and Winnipeg. Cities also often build parks at confluences, sometimes as projects of municipal improvement, as at Portland and Pittsburgh. In other cases, a confluence is an industrial site, as in Philadelphia or Mannheim. Often a confluence lies in the shared floodplain of the two rivers and nothing is built on it, for example at Manaus, described below.
One other way that confluences may be exploited by humans is as sacred places in religions. Rogers suggests that for the ancient peoples of the Iron Age in northwest Europe, watery locations were often sacred, especially sources and confluences. Pre-Christian Slavic peoples chose confluences as the sites for fortified triangular temples, where they practiced human sacrifice and other sacred rites. In Hinduism, the confluence of two sacred rivers often is a pilgrimage site for ritual bathing. In Pittsburgh, a number of adherents to Mayanism consider their city's confluence to be sacred.

Bourne (stream),"A bourne is an intermittent stream, flowing from a spring. Frequent in chalk and limestone country where the rock becomes saturated with winter rain, that slowly drains away until the rock becomes dry, when the stream ceases. The word is from the Anglo-Saxon language of England. 
The word can be found in northern England in placenames such as: Redbourne and Legbourne but is commonly in use in southern England (particularly Dorset) as a name for a small river, particularly in compound names such as winterbourne. A winterbourne is a stream or river that is dry through the summer months.
Bourne is used as a place name or as a part of a place name, usually in chalk downland countryside. Alternative forms are bourn or borne or born. The apparent variant, borne found in the placename: Camborne, arises from the Cornish language and is in fact a false friend: it refers to a hill (Cornish: bronn, from Common Brythonic *brunda; compare Welsh bryn). Born/borne in German also means fount, or spring, and is related to the Indo-European root, *bhreu.  That born/borne appears throughout Europe as a placename is also an important clue that this spelling is an etymological precursor to the Middle English bourne/burn.
Cf. Burn (landform), in common use in Scotland and North East England especially, but also found (in placenames) elsewhere in England such as: Blackburn, Gisburn, Woburn, Kilburn, Winkburn, and so forth.
For rivers and places named Bourne or having this word as part of the name, see Bourne (disambiguation).

South America,"South America is a continent entirely in the Western Hemisphere and mostly in the Southern Hemisphere, with a considerably smaller portion in the Northern Hemisphere. It can also be described as the southern subregion of the Americas.
South America is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean, on the north and east by the Atlantic Ocean, and to the south by the Drake Passage; North America and the Caribbean Sea lie to the northwest.
The continent includes twelve sovereign states: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay, and Venezuela; two dependent territories: the Falkland Islands and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands; and one internal territory: French Guiana.
The Dutch Caribbean ABC islands (Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao) and Trinidad and Tobago are geologically located on the South-American continental shelf, and thus may be considered part of South America as well. Panama, Ascension Island (a part of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha) and Bouvet Island (a dependency of Norway) may also be considered parts of South America.
South America has an area of 17,840,000 square kilometers (6,890,000 sq mi). Its population as of 2021 has been estimated at more than 434 million. South America ranks fourth in area (after Asia, Africa, and North America) and fifth in population (after Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America). Brazil is by far the most populous South American country, with almost half of the continent's population, followed by Colombia, Argentina, Venezuela, and Peru. In recent decades, Brazil has also generated half of the continent's GDP and has become the continent's first regional power.
Most of the population lives near the continent's western or eastern coasts while the interior and the far south are sparsely populated. The geography of western South America is dominated by the Andes mountains; in contrast, the eastern part contains both highland regions and vast lowlands where rivers such as the Amazon, Orinoco and Paraná flow. Most of the continent lies in the tropics, except for a large part of the Southern Cone located in the middle latitudes.
The continent's cultural and ethnic outlook has its origin with the interaction of Indigenous peoples with European conquerors and immigrants and, more locally, with African slaves. Given a long history of colonialism, the overwhelming majority of South Americans speak Spanish or Portuguese, and societies and states are rich in Western traditions. Relative to Africa, Asia, and Europe, post-1900 South America has been a peaceful continent with few wars, although high rates of violent crime remain a concern in some countries.

History
Prehistory
South America is thought to have been first inhabited by humans when people were crossing the Bering Land Bridge (now the Bering Strait) at least 15,000 years ago from the territory that is present-day Russia. They migrated south through North America, and eventually reached South America through the Isthmus of Panama.
Amongst the oldest evidence for human presence in South America is the Monte Verde II site in Chile, suggested to date to around 14,500 years ago. From around 13,000 years ago, the Fishtail projectile point style became widespread across South America, with its disappearance around 11,000 years ago coincident with the disappearance of South America's megafauna. Maize was present in northern South America by around 6,000 years ago.
By 2000 BC, many agrarian communities had been settled throughout the Andes and the surrounding regions. Fishing became a widespread practice along the coast, helping establish fish as a primary source of food. Irrigation systems were also developed at this time, which aided in the rise of an agrarian society.
South American cultures began domesticating llamas and alpacas in the highlands of the Andes circa 3500 BC. Besides their use as sources of meat and wool, these animals were used for transportation of goods.

Pre-Columbian civilizations
The rise of plant growing and the subsequent appearance of permanent human settlements allowed for the multiple and overlapping beginnings of civilizations in South America.
One of the earliest known South American civilizations was Caral–Supe, on the central Peruvian coast. Though a pre-ceramic culture, the monumental architecture of Caral–Supe created one of the first cities of the world, generally dated to around 3500 BC, at Huaricanga in the Fortaleza area, contemporaneous with the pyramids of Ancient Egypt, one of the oldest-known civilizations in the Americas and one of the six sites where civilization separately originated in the ancient world. Caral–Supe governing class established a trade network and developed agriculture then followed by Chavín by 900 BC, according to some estimates and archaeological finds. Artifacts were found at a site called Chavín de Huantar in modern Peru at an elevation of 3,177 meters (10,423 ft).

BMW V12 LMR Art Car,"The BMW Art Car Project was introduced by the French racecar driver and auctioneer Hervé Poulain, who wanted to invite an artist to create a canvas on an automobile.
In 1975, Poulain commissioned American artist and friend Alexander Calder to paint the first BMW Art Car. This first example would be a BMW 3.0 CSL which Poulain himself would race in the 1975 24 Hours of Le Mans endurance race.
Since Calder's work of art, many other renowned artists throughout the world have created BMW Art Cars, including  David Hockney, Jenny Holzer, Roy Lichtenstein, Robert Rauschenberg, Frank Stella, and Andy Warhol. To date, a total of 20 BMW Art Cars, based on both racing and regular production vehicles, have been created. Frank Stella also made one unofficial art car at the behest of race car driver Peter Gregg. The most recent artist to the join BMW Art Car program is Julie Mehretu in 2024 with her BMW M Hybrid V8. Artists for the BMW Art Car Project are chosen by a panel of international judges.
According to Thomas Girst, who has been in charge of the BMW Art Cars project since 2004, the purpose of the project has changed over time: ""In the beginning the cars were raced. There wasn't much of a public relations effort around them... Since then, some of the Art Cars have been used in advertisements to show that BMW is a player in the arts. With the Eliason work, part of what we are doing is raising awareness of alternative and renewable energy sources.""
On November 17, 2022, the BMW M1 Procar painted by Andy Warhol was vandalized with flour by climate activists while on display in Milan.

BMW Art Cars
* The 2009 project by Robin Rhode did not create an art car, but rather used a BMW Z4 driven over a giant canvas to create a work by applying paint with the car's tires.
** Car shown in the BMW Museum, without the original digital lighting enhancements that were part of the art.

Miniatures
Since 2003, BMW has released the Art Cars (at the time, this encompassed the entire series) as 1:18 scale miniature diecast.
They are sold in limited edition by BMW dealers and shops. All of them have an elegant acrylic display and a grey base, iconic package with red box and an ""art car"" booklet inside. The first two to be released were Alexander Calder's BMW 3.0 CSL and Jenny Holzer's BMW V12 LMR. Initially 3000 copies each were to be produced with an MSRP of $125 (now $145) each.
Nowadays there are 17 miniatures, but there are 19 Bmw art cars, simply of 2 there are no miniatures. Only the works of Olafur Eliasson and Cao Fei do not have official miniatures because they are conceptual works.

Public display
In 2009, the Art Cars began a North American tour, starting at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art from February 12–24.  The second stop was in New York City from March 24 to April 6, in a special exhibit at Grand Central Terminal held in its Vanderbilt Hall. The Cars were exhibited in México, first in MARCO, Monterrey, and later in Guadalajara and Mexico City. In July 2012 a selection of the cars were presented by the Institute of Contemporary Arts in a Shoreditch car park as part of the London 2012 Festival, entitled Art Drive!.

Unofficial BMW Art Cars
In addition to the work commissioned by BMW, other artists have created unofficial BMW art cars. In 1979 racing driver Peter Gregg purchased a BMW M1 Procar and commissioned his friend Frank Stella to paint it for him; this car is the only BMW painted by an artist who was also part of BMW's own Art Car program. and was sold from the Guggenheim Museum to a BMW dealer in Long Island, New York in 2011. The car is part of Stella's ""Polar Coordinates"" series, created to commemorate Stella's friend Ronnie Peterson who had died in a racing incident at Monza in 1978. In 1987 Keith Haring painted a red BMW Z1 at Hans Mayer Gallery, Düsseldorf. In 1996 Artist Dennis Simon was commissioned to create a BMW Motorsport tribute on the flanks of a 1965 BMW 1800 Ti/SA for BMW's 80th birthday at the Monterey Historics in Laguna Seca, CA. In 2007, Portland's Museum of Contemporary Craft commissioned artist Tom Cramer to paint a 1977 BMW 320i for their grand opening at the DeSoto Building. In 2016, the Cultural Council of Greater Jacksonville commissioned artist Christie Chandler to paint a BMW X6 for their annual awards gala at TPC Sawgrass.

History
Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures (with comments and a rejoinder by the author)

Author: Leo Breiman
Publication data: 
Online version: https://projecteuclid.org/journals/statistical-science/volume-16/issue-3/Statistical-Modeling--The-Two-Cultures-with-comments-and-a/10.1214/ss/1009213726.pdf
Description: Describes two cultures of statistics, one using a parsimonious and generative stochastic model, while the other is an algorithmic model with no known mechanism for how the data is generated. Breiman argues that while statistics has traditionally favored using the stochastic model, there is value in expanding the methods that statisticians can use to study phenomenon.
Importance: Influence on the philosophies of statisticians right before the increased use of machine learning and deep learning methods. In a 20-year retrospective on this article, ""Breiman's words are perhaps more relevant than ever"". Notable statisticians at the time wrote opinion pieces about the publication. Although overall critical of the publication, David Cox writes that the publication ""contains enough truth and exposes enough weaknesses to be thought-provoking."" Bradley Efron commented that this publication is a ""stimulating paper"". Emanuel Parzen also comments about this publication that ""Breiman alerts us to systematic blunders (leading to wrong conclusions) that have been committed applying current statistical practice of data modeling"".

Outline of economics,"The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to economics. Economics is a branch of science that analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. It aims to explain how economies work and how agents (people) respond to incentives.
Economics is a behavioral science (a scientific discipline that focuses on the study of human behavior) as well as a social science  (a scientific discipline that explores aspects of human society).

Branches of economics
Macroeconomics – branch of economics dealing with the performance, structure, behavior, and decision-making of an economy as a whole, rather than individual markets.
Microeconomics – branch of economics that studies the behavior of individuals and firms in making decisions regarding the allocation of limited resources.

Subdisciplines of economics
Agricultural economics – applied field of economics concerned with the application of economic theory in optimizing the production and distribution of food and fiber products.
Attention economics – approach to the management of information that treats human attention as a scarce commodity and applies economic theory to solve various information management problems
Behavioral economics – study of the psychological (e.g. cognitive, behavioral, affective, social) factors involved in the decisions of individuals or institutions, and how these decisions deviate from those implied by traditional economic theory.
Classical economics – theory of market economies as largely self-regulating systems, governed by natural laws of production and exchange
Comparative economic systems – sub-classification of economics dealing with the comparative study of different systems of economic organization, such as capitalism, socialism, feudalism and the mixed economy.
Contract theory – how economic actors can and do construct contractual arrangements, generally in the presence of information asymmetry
Cultural economics – branch of economics that studies the relation of culture to economic outcomes.
Demographic economics – application of economic analysis to demography, the study of human populations, including size, growth, density, distribution, and vital statistics.
Development economics – branch of economics that deals with economic aspects of the development process in low- and middle- income countries
Ecological economics – transdisciplinary and interdisciplinary field of academic research addressing the interdependence and coevolution of human economies and natural ecosystems, both intertemporally and spatially.
Econometrics – application of statistical methods to economic data in order to give empirical content to economic relationships.
Economic anthropology – field that attempts to explain human economic behavior in its widest historic, geographic and cultural scope, an amalgamation of economics and anthropology.
Economic development – process by which the economic well-being and quality of life of a nation, region, local community, or an individual are improved according to targeted goals and objectives.
Economic geography – subfield of human geography that studies economic activity and factors affecting it. It can also be considered a subfield or method in economics.
Economic history – study of history using methodological tools from economics or with a special attention to economic phenomena.
Economic sociology – study of the social cause and effect of various economic phenomena
Economics of marriage – economic analysis of household formation and break up, of production and distribution decisions within the household.
Education economics – study of economic issues relating to education, including the demand for education, the financing and provision of education, and the comparative efficiency of various educational programs and policies.
Energy economics – broad scientific subject area which includes topics related to supply and use of energy in societies.
Engineering economics – subset of economics concerned with the use and application of economic principles in the analysis of engineering decisions.
Entrepreneurial economics – field of study that focuses on the study of entrepreneur and entrepreneurship within the economy.
Environmental economics –sub-field of economics concerned with environmental issues.
Family economics – applies economic concepts such as production, division of labor, distribution, and decision making to the family.
Feminist economics –critical study of economics and economies, with a focus on gender-aware and inclusive economic inquiry and policy analysis
Financial economics –branch of economics characterized by a ""concentration on monetary activities"", in which ""money of one type or another is likely to appear on both sides of a trade""

Greater city movements,"A greater city movement refers to various reform efforts—both contemporary and historical—to expand the municipal boundaries of a primate central city to incorporate all, or part, of the surrounding metropolitan population. Historically, greater city movements were proposed as a solution to the problem of metropolitan planning and administration. Today, the concept has been largely discredited for political reasons Historically, examples of cities that have successfully expanded their boundaries to include the entire metropolitan population are extremely rare, and as a general principle few, if any cities worldwide have been able to maintain a continuous process of boundary adjustment to include surrounding areas of population growth.
The greater city movements of the early twentieth century grew out of concern for improving urban health, efficiency and aesthetics. They also reflected the longstanding historical understanding of cities as a politically unified entity. Larger municipal governments with greater resources were seen as a means for implementing the ideas of municipal socialism, City beautiful and the garden city.
Greater city movements are distinct from ""regionalism"" movements, which seek to create an additional tier of regional metropolitan government (Such as Grand Paris in 2016).

Examples
Australia
In Australia the movement led to the creation of a greater Brisbane (1925) which is considered the only true implantation of the ""greater city"" model. More limited successes were achieved in Newcastle (1938) and Perth (1914–1917). Elsewhere, including Melbourne and Sydney, the movement was entirely unsuccessful and today, the idea of large, metropolitan local authorities coordinating development, infrastructure, financing is rarely identified as a model for urban and regional planning. Examples of successful and partially successful movements include the following:

Perth: The amalgamation of several inner city municipalities occurred between 1914 and 1917, but was reversed by the state government in 1993. Efforts to encourage an amalgamation of the City of Perth and the City of Vincent failed in 2013 although the City of Perth was expanded to include the University of Western Australia and surrounding neighbourhood.
Brisbane (1924): The only truly successful implementation of the greater city movement in Australia.
Newcastle (1937)
Wollongong (1947)

Canada
Toronto: Seven municipalities were amalgamated into the City of Toronto in 1997.

United Kingdom
Glasgow
Birmingham: The city was expanded to include adjoining districts in 1891, 1909, 1911, 1928, 1931 and 1974.
London: The London County Council was created in 1889.

United States
New York: The creation of the City of Greater New York in 1898.

Intelligence literature,"Intelligence literature, sometimes referred to as espionage nonfiction, is a genre of non-fiction or historical literature, written in any language, that focuses on the field of intelligence, also known as Espionage. This field of literature includes biographies and autobiographies of intelligence officers, historical research and analysis of intelligence operations and missions, studies of undercover work, policy and legal studies surrounding the fields of intelligence law, intelligence history, and national security law, academic and professional journals, essays, textbooks, and more. Other works of intelligence literature include official histories, official reports, tradecraft and technical manuals, declassified documents and archival materials, and oral histories and interviews.

The origins of intelligence literature
Intelligence literature is rooted in the original works of myth, folklore, oral tradition, political science and philosophy, as spycraft has always been a tool of statecraft, warfare, and diplomacy, and for the majority of its history, intelligence literature was wrapped-up into these genres. In ancient cultures, there often was no distinction between fiction and nonfiction. It took hundreds to thousands of years for it to become its own, unique, genre of literature.

Ancient Egypt
The Story of Wenamun is a Hieratic Late Egyptian literary text that focuses on Wenamun, a priest of Amun at Karnak, is sent by the High Priest of Amun Herihor on a secret mission to the Phoenician city of Byblos to acquire lumber (probably cedar wood) to build a new ship to transport the cult image of Amun. After visiting Smendes (Nesbanebded in Egyptian) at Tanis, Wenamun stopped at the port of Dor ruled by the Tjeker prince Beder, where he was robbed. Upon reaching Byblos, he was shocked by the hostile reception he received there. When he finally gained an audience with Zakar-Baal, the local king, the latter refused to give the requested goods for free, as had been the traditional custom, instead demanding payment. Wenamun had to send to Smendes for payment, a humiliating move that demonstrates the waning of Egyptian power over the Eastern Mediterranean; a causative factor of a new nature can be seen in this ebbing of Egyptian power — the rise of Assyria and its intrusion into Phoenicia around the year 1100 BCE. After a wait of almost a year at Byblos, Wenamun attempted to leave for Egypt, only to be blown off course to Alashiya (Cyprus), where he was almost killed by an angry mob before placing himself under the protection of the local queen, whom he called Hatbi. At this point the story breaks off.

Rome
Strategemata is a work by the Roman writer Frontinus, written in the 1st century, which focuses on military strategy, but does include discussions on deception and intelligence gathering. This book is more accurately defined as Military history, but includes within it sections on Intelligence history. The first section of this book is entitled ""On Concealing One's Plans,"" and the second is entitled ""On Discovering the Enemy's Plans,"" both of which are directly related to the fields of intelligence collection and counterintelligence.

India
Arthashastra (Sanskrit: अर्थशास्त्रम्, IAST: Kautiliyam Arthaśāstram) is an Ancient Indian Sanskrit treatise on statecraft, politics, economic policy and military strategy. The Arthashastra explores issues of social welfare, the collective ethics that hold a society together, advising the king that in times and in areas devastated by famine, epidemic and such acts of nature, or by war, he should initiate public projectssuch as creating irrigation waterways and building forts around major strategic holdings and towns and exempt taxes on those affected. The text was influenced by Hindu texts such as the sections on kings, governance and legal procedures included in Manusmriti.

China
In China, the author Sun Tzu is perhaps most well known for his seminal work, The Art of War. In the Art of War, Sun Tzu suggests tactics and strategies for spies, but in the broader conception of warfighting. The Art of War is an early inspiration for many intelligence officers and leaders of intelligence agencies, but it is not, on its own, a work of intelligence literature.

The Crusades
During the Crusades, the Knights Templar, which was engaged in espionage activities in the Holy Land, might have published manuals on clandestine activities. However, after the Templar Order was disbanded in 1312 by Pope Clement V, many of their records were seized or destroyed. Some theorists speculate that if the Templars had intelligence manuals, they were either lost or kept secret by successor groups (e.g., the Freemasons or other knightly orders).

⁠. Real fluids are viscous (""sticky"") and contain (and conduct) heat. Perfect fluids are idealized models in which these possibilities are ignored. Specifically, perfect fluids have no shear stresses, viscosity, or heat conduction. 
A quark–gluon plasma
and graphene are examples of nearly perfect fluids that could be studied in a laboratory.

Non-relativistic fluid mechanics
In classical mechanics, ideal fluids are described by Euler equations. Ideal fluids produce no drag according to d'Alembert's paradox. If a fluid produced drag, then work would be needed to move an object through the fluid and that work would produce heat or fluid motion. However, a perfect fluid can not dissipate energy and it can't transmit energy infinitely far from the object.: 34 
A flock of birds in the medium of air is an example of a perfect fluid; an electron gas is also modeled as a perfect fluid.

Superfluidity
Superfluids are fluids with zero viscosity, however in practice superfluids cannot be accurately described as a perfect fluid. In the two-fluid model, superfluids are macroscopically considered as having two-coexisting phases, a mixture between a normal fluid and a perfect fluid.

Cosmology and astrophysics
Perfect fluids are a fluid solution used in general relativity to model idealized distributions of matter, such as the interior of a star or an isotropic universe. In the latter case, the symmetry of the cosmological principle and the equation of state of the perfect fluid lead to Friedmann equation for the expansion of the universe.

Subregion,"A subregion is a part of a larger geographical region or continent. Cardinal directions are commonly used to define subregions. There are many criteria for creating systems of subregions; this article is focusing on the United Nations geoscheme, which is a changing, constantly updated, UN tool based on specific political geography and demography considerations relevant in UN statistics.

United Nations subregions
The Statistics Division of the United Nations (UN) is in charge of the collection, processing, and dissemination of statistical information for the UN. In 1999, it developed a system of macro-geographical (continental) regions, subregions, and other selected economic groups to report advances towards achieving numerous Millennium Development Goals worldwide. These statistical divisions were devised for statistical purposes and is used for carrying out statistical analysis. The division's first publication was the book World's Women 2000: Trends and Statistics in 2000.
According to the UN, the assignment of countries or areas to specific groupings is for statistical convenience and does not imply any assumption regarding political or other affiliation of countries or territories.

Subregions by landmass and continent
The following is a non-exhaustive list of subregions, arranged alphabetically by region (i.e., by continent); in the UN geoscheme, higher-level, macro-geographical regions are arranged to the extent possible according to continents.

Open Connect,"Open Connect is a content distribution network specifically developed by Netflix to deliver its TV shows and movies to avoid traffic and fees.
Netflix provides physical appliances to internet service providers that allow them to avoid traffic during peak hours of streaming or sustain the anticipated ones. By shipping copies of content to these appliances ahead of time, the devices can store duplicates of titles, thereby reducing the network burden. Also, Netflix places its servers in locations with the highest number of subscribers and forms partnerships with ISP networks or IXPs. 
Furthermore, Netflix adapts its content to the quality of the network. This is achieved by sending three copies of each title, each at a different quality level, to its servers. For example, if a user's ISP is overwhelmed or the Internet connection is poor, the system can select a lower-bitrate version of the title.

History
Netflix launched Open Connect in 2012. Since then, Netflix has spent over $1 billion to develop and distribute more than 8,000 Open Connect Appliances (OCA). The service started working on the free-of-charge distribution of OCAs in cooperation with ISPs. So far, more than 1,000 ISPs have acquired and installed OCAs, which has allowed them to save $1.25 billion by 2021.
In the case of an OCA that is hosted at an IXP, Netflix maintains ownership of the OCA and is responsible for covering its own expenses such as power consumption, colocation fees, cross-connect fees, and other related costs. Netflix has installed OCAs in over 52 IXPs around the world, enabling a connection with any ISP.

Deployment
IX deployment
Netflix deploys OCAs within IXPs located in major Netflix markets around the world. These OCAs are interconnected with ISPs present at the same location through free public or private peering.

Embedded deployment
OCAs are directly installed within ISP networks. While Netflix supplies the server hardware at no cost, ISPs are responsible for providing space, power, and connectivity.

Requirements
Three primary factors that determine the number of appliances that need to be deployed are:

The network architecture requirements
The maximum amount of Netflix traffic to be delivered from a particular site
The availability and failover options that can be implemented at that site.

Hardware
Open Connect is a combination of local servers, referred to as OCAs, and additional infrastructure. Netflix has developed storage appliances that are used to store the content in many IX locations globally and are embedded at larger ISP partner locations. The storage holds up to 350 TB, therefore, if something from storage becomes popular, Netflix will move that title onto the other server called flash server which serves large traffic.

Software
These are used software for designing Open Connect Appliance Software:

Operating system – FreeBSD
Web server – NGINX
Routing Intelligence Proxy – BIRD internet routing daemon
IP support – IPv4 and IPv6
Other software handle content management and transmits information regarding the system's health and other statistics to the Open Connect supporting services at Netflix.

Benefits
Open Connect permits ISPs to circumvent the expenses associated with transit charge and costly international backhaul capacity by delivering the traffic directly to the ISP instead of through a transit link.
If an ISP has multiple OCAs in place, it is possible to transmit the traffic to the consumer from a server nearby, which reduces costs for the core network capacity.
Open Connect assists wideband networks in retaining their customers by preventing slow speed and instability. Moreover, if one element fails, it is possible to redirect the traffic to other servers, which minimizes the risk of downtime.
Netflix invests in delivery infrastructure, such as OCAs, as well as compression technology, to optimize the delivery of its content and support the growing global demand for video content and broadband internet access.
The OCAs report their health values and receive their configurations from the Open Connect supporting services (if it is reachable from the Network Operations Center). Netflix also automatically incorporates feedback on the health information into its content routing decisions.

Cabbeling,"Cabbeling is when two separate water parcels mix to form a third which sinks below both parents. The combined water parcel is denser than the original two water parcels.
The two parent water parcels may have the same density, but they have different properties; for instance, different salinities and temperatures. Seawater almost always gets denser if it gets either slightly colder or slightly saltier. But medium-warm, medium-salty water can be denser than both fresher, colder water and saltier, warmer water; in other words, the equation of state for seawater is monotonic, but non-linear. See diagram.
Cabbeling may also occur in fresh water, since pure water is densest at about 4 °C (39 °F). A mixture of 1 °C water and 6 °C water, for instance, might have a temperature of 4 °C, making it denser than either parent. Ice is also less dense than water, so although ice floats in warm water, meltwater sinks in warm water.
The densification of the new mixed water parcel is a result of a slight contraction upon mixing; a decrease in volume of the combined water parcel.  A new water parcel that has the same mass, but is lower in volume, will be denser.  Denser water sinks or downwells in the otherwise neutral surface of the water body, where the two initial water parcels originated.

History of term
The importance of this process in oceanography was first pointed out  by Witte, in a 1902 publication (Witte, E. (1902). ""Zur Theorie der Stromkabbelungen"" (PDF). Gaea, Köln.).
The German origin of the term has caused some etymological confusion and disagreements as to the correct spelling of the term; for details, see the Wiktionary entry on cabelling. Oceanographers generally follow Stommel and refer to the process as ""cabbeling"".

High-latitude cabbeling
Cabbeling may occur in high incidence in high latitude waters. Polar region waters are a place where cold and fresh water melting from sea ice meets warmer, saltier water.  Ocean currents are responsible for bringing this warmer, saltier water to higher latitudes, especially on the eastern shores of Northern Hemisphere continents, and on the western shores of Southern Hemisphere continents.  The phenomenon of cabbeling has been particularly noted in the Weddell Sea and the Greenland Sea.

FOCJ,"Functional Overlapping Competing Jurisdictions (FOCJ, also Functional, Overlapping and Competing Jurisdictions) is a moderate form of panarchy advocated by Swiss economists Bruno Frey and Reiner Eichenberger.
Under FOCJ, government operations are divided into multiple organisations each known as a FOCUS.  FOCJ are:

Functional, as they deal with one matter only, such as education, policing, or roads.
Overlapping, since the individuals or region covered by a FOCUS providing one function might be covered by multiple FOCJ in respect of another function.
Competing, as FOCJ providing the same function compete with one another.  For some functions, each individual may choose which FOCUS will apply to them; however, if the function is territorially bound, each town votes to select its FOCUS.  For example, an FOCJ nation may have three police forces, with each town voting as to which of the three shall provide its policing.
A jurisdiction, because a FOCUS is a separate political unit, and may, for example, levy taxes upon the individuals or towns selecting it.

Climate change and cities,"Climate change and cities are deeply connected. Cities are one of the greatest contributors and likely best opportunities for addressing climate change. Cities are also one of the most vulnerable parts of the human society to the effects of climate change, and likely one of the most important solutions for reducing the environmental impact of humans. The UN projects that 68% of the world population will live in urban areas by 2050. In the year 2016, 31 mega-cities reported having at least 10 million in their population, 8 of which surpassed 20 million people. However, secondary cities - small to medium size cities (500,000 to 1 million) are rapidly increasing in number and are some of the fastest growing urbanizing areas in the world further contributing to climate change impacts. Cities have a significant influence on construction and transportation—two of the key contributors to global warming emissions. Moreover, because of processes that create climate conflict and climate refugees, city areas are expected to grow during the next several decades, stressing infrastructure and concentrating more impoverished peoples in cities.High density and urban heat island effect are examples of weather changes that impact cities due to climate change. It also causes exacerbating existing problems such as air pollution, water scarcity, and heat illness in metropolitan areas. Moreover, because most cities have been built on rivers or coastal areas, cities are frequently vulnerable to the subsequent effects of sea level rise, which cause flooding and erosion; these effects are also connected with other urban environmental problems, such as subsidence and aquifer depletion.

A report by the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group described consumption based emissions as having significantly more impact than production-based emissions within cities. The report estimates that 85% of the emissions associated with goods within a city is generated outside of that city. Climate change adaptation and mitigation investments in cities will be important in reducing the impacts of some of the largest contributors of greenhouse gas emissions: for example, increased density allows for redistribution of land use for agriculture and reforestation, improving transportation efficiencies, and greening construction (largely due to cement's outsized role in climate change and improvements in sustainable construction practices and weatherization).

Climate Change and Urbanization
In the most recent past, increasing urbanization has also been proposed as a phenomenon that has a reducing effect on the global rate of carbon emission primarily because with urbanization comes technical prowess which can help drive sustainability. Lists of high impact climate change solutions tend to include city-focused solutions; for example, Project Drawdown recommends several major urban investments, including improved bicycle infrastructure, building retrofitting, district heating, public transit, and walkable cities as important solutions.
In order to activate and focus attention on climate change solutions, the international community has formed coalitions of cities such as C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group and ICLEI) as well as policy goals, Sustainable Development Goal 11 (""sustainable cities and communities”). Currently, in 2022, there is a deterioration in the progress of the goal. There is limited progress on making cities and human settlements more appropriate to live in Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean and the Pacific Island countries. There is fair progress in Central and Southern Asia and Eastern and South-Eastern Asian. However, it has been achieved in Developed countries.
There is an ongoing paradigm shift in urban planning that is focused on development of climate friendly and resilience by using climate urbanism. Climate urbanism aims to protect physical and digital infrastructures of urban economies from the hazards associated with climate change. Being that cities bring in 80% of the world's revenue, it is important for the infrastructure and planning of these urban areas to be planned out using carbon management and climate resilient infrastructure. [1]

Background
More than half of the world's population is in cities, consuming a large portion of food and goods produced outside of cities. The UN projects that 68% of the world population will live in urban areas by 2050. In the year 2016, 31 mega-cities reported having at least 10 million in their population, 8 of which surpassed 20 million people. However, secondary cities - small to medium size cities (500,000 to 1 million) are rapidly increasing in number and are some of the fastest growing urbanizing areas in the world further contributing to climate change impacts.

Emissions
Cities globally house half of the world's people, consume 80% of the world's energy and 70% of its natural resources, and contribute more than 70% of global CO2 emissions.

Pockmark (geology),"Pockmarks are concave, crater-like depressions on seabeds that are caused by fluids (liquids and gasses) escaping and erupting through the seafloor. They can vary in size and have been found worldwide.
Pockmarks were discovered off the coasts of Nova Scotia, Canada in the late 1960s by Lew King and Brian McLean of the Bedford Institute of Oceanography, using a new side scan sonar developed in the late 1960s by Kelvin Hughes. Before the two researchers King and McLean used the side scan sonar, they had noticed 'notches' on echo sounder and shallow seismic records in the seafloor off Nova Scotia. They believed these notches to represent gullies and curvilinear troughs in the muddy seafloor. However, they could never work out how to join these notches from one survey line to the next. It was, therefore, not before they surveyed with the area-coverage system, Side scan sonar, that they realized the notches were in fact closed depressions (craters) and not curvilinear features. This was a great surprise, because there are very few craters on the Earth's surface.
Although pockmarks were first documented and published 50 years ago, they are currently still being discovered on the ocean floor and in many lakes, the world over. Spatial delineation and morphometric characterisation of pockmarks in the central North Sea seabed have been achieved by semi-automatic methods.
The craters off Nova Scotia are up to 150 m (490 ft) in diameter and 10 m (33 ft) deep. Pockmarks have been found worldwide.  Discovery was aided by the use of high-resolution multibeam acoustic systems for bathymetric mapping. In these cases, pockmarks have been interpreted as the morphological expression of gas or oil leakage from active hydrocarbon system or a deep overpressured petroleum reservoir. Specifically, long-term deep fluid flow resulting in pockmarks is linked to undersea methane gas escape under pressure.

Chemical free,"Chemical free is a term used in marketing to imply that a product is safe, healthy or environmentally friendly because it only contains natural ingredients. The term is a misnomer, as all substances and objects are composed entirely of chemicals and energy. The term chemical is roughly a synonym for matter, and all substances, such as water and air, are chemicals.
The use of the term chemical free in advertising to indicate that a product is free of synthetic chemicals, and the tolerance of its use in this fashion by the United Kingdom's Advertising Standards Authority, has been the subject of criticism.
A study on American undergraduates' understanding of the term chemical, conducted by chemist Gayle Nicoll in 1997, noted that ""People may hold both a scientific and layman's definition of a chemical without linking the two together in any way. They may or may not consciously distinguish that the term 'chemical' has different connotations depending on the situation.""

Island mentality,"Island mentality is the notion of isolated communities perceiving themselves as exceptional or superior to the rest of the world. This term does not directly refer to an island or other geographically confined society, but to the cultural, moral, or ideological superiority of a community or a person that lacks social exposure to the outside world. Island mentality can be characterized by narrow-mindedness, ignorance, or outright hostility towards any artifact (concept, ideology, lifestyle choice, art form, etc.) originating from outside the geographic area inhabited by the society.
The term ""island mentality"" is also used in some psychological research to describe individuals who dislike or have problems with relating to others, and then live as loners or ""islands"". This concept (in which people may feel inferior, afraid, or alone) is unrelated to the above terminology.

Europe,"Europe is a continent located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere and mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere. It is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, and Asia to the east. Europe shares the landmass of Eurasia with Asia, and of Afro-Eurasia with both Africa and Asia. Europe is commonly considered to be separated from Asia by the watershed of the Ural Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian Sea, the Greater Caucasus, the Black Sea, and the waterway of the Bosporus Strait.
Europe covers approx. 10,186,000 square kilometres (3,933,000 sq mi), or 2% of Earth's surface (6.8% of Earth's land area), making it the second-smallest continent (using the seven-continent model). Politically, Europe is divided into about fifty sovereign states, of which Russia is the largest and most populous, spanning 39% of the continent and comprising 15% of its population. Europe had a total population of about 745 million (about 10% of the world population) in 2021; the third-largest after Asia and Africa. The European climate is affected by warm Atlantic currents, such as the Gulf Stream, which produce a temperate climate, tempering winters and summers, on much of the continent. Further from the sea, seasonal differences are more noticeable producing more continental climates.
The culture of Europe consists of a range of national and regional cultures, which form the central roots of the wider Western civilisation, and together commonly reference ancient Greece and ancient Rome, particularly through their Christian successors, as crucial and shared roots. Beginning with the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 CE, Christian consolidation of Europe in the wake of the Migration Period marked the European post-classical Middle Ages. The Italian Renaissance spread across many Western European countries, adapting to local contexts and giving rise to distinct national expressions. The renewed humanist emphasis on art and science was among the several factors that contributed to the broader transition to the modern era. Since the Age of Discovery, led by Spain and Portugal, Europe played a predominant role in global affairs with multiple explorations and conquests around the world. Between the 16th and 20th centuries, European powers colonised at various times the Americas, almost all of Africa and Oceania, and the majority of Asia.
The Age of Enlightenment, the French Revolution, and the Napoleonic Wars shaped the continent culturally, politically, and economically from the end of the 17th century until the first half of the 19th century. The Industrial Revolution, which began in Great Britain at the end of the 18th century, gave rise to radical economic, cultural, and social change in Western Europe and eventually the wider world. Both world wars began and were fought to a great extent in Europe, contributing to a decline in Western European dominance in world affairs by the mid-20th century as the Soviet Union and the United States took prominence and competed over ideological dominance and international influence in Europe and globally. The resulting Cold War divided Europe along the Iron Curtain, with NATO in the West and the Warsaw Pact in the East. This divide ended with the Revolutions of 1989, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, which allowed European integration to advance significantly.
European integration has been advanced institutionally since 1948 with the founding of the Council of Europe, and significantly through the realisation of the European Union (EU), which represents today the majority of Europe. The European Union is a supranational political entity that lies between a confederation and a federation and is based on a system of European treaties. The EU originated in Western Europe but has been expanding eastward since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. A majority of its members have adopted a common currency, the euro, and participate in the European single market and a customs union. A large bloc of countries, the Schengen Area, have also abolished internal border and immigration controls. Regular popular elections take place every five years within the EU; they are considered to be the second-largest democratic elections in the world after India's. The EU economy is the second-largest in the world by nominal GDP and third-largest by PPP-adjusted GDP.

Etymology
The place name Evros was first used by the ancient Greeks to refer to their northernmost province, which bears the same name today. The principal river there – Evros (today's Maritsa) – flows through the fertile valleys of Thrace, which itself was also called Europe, before the term meant the continent.
In classical Greek mythology, Europa (Ancient Greek: Εὐρώπη, Eurṓpē) was a Phoenician princess. One view is that her name derives from the Ancient Greek elements εὐρύς (eurús) 'wide, broad', and ὤψ (ōps, gen. ὠπός, ōpós) 'eye, face, countena",Continents,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe,1,europe continent located entirely northern hemisphere mostly eastern hemisphere bordered arctic ocean north atlantic ocean west mediterranean sea south asia east europe share landmass eurasia asia afroeurasia africa asia europe commonly considered separated asia watershed ural mountain ural river caspian sea greater caucasus black sea waterway bosporus strait europe cover approx square kilometre sq mi earth surface earth land area making secondsmallest continent using sevencontinent model politically europe divided fifty sovereign state russia largest populous spanning continent comprising population europe total population million world population thirdlargest asia africa european climate affected warm atlantic current gulf stream produce temperate climate tempering winter summer much continent sea seasonal difference noticeable producing continental climate culture europe consists range national regional culture form central root wider western civilisation together commonly reference ancient greece ancient rome particularly christian successor crucial shared root beginning fall western roman empire ce christian consolidation europe wake migration period marked european postclassical middle age italian renaissance spread across many western european country adapting local context giving rise distinct national expression renewed humanist emphasis art science among several factor contributed broader transition modern era since age discovery led spain portugal europe played predominant role global affair multiple exploration conquest around world th th century european power colonised various time america almost africa oceania majority asia age enlightenment french revolution napoleonic war shaped continent culturally politically economically end th century first half th century industrial revolution began great britain end th century gave rise radical economic cultural social change western europe eventually wider world world war began fought great extent europe contributing decline western european dominance world affair midth century soviet union united state took prominence competed ideological dominance international influence europe globally resulting cold war divided europe along iron curtain nato west warsaw pact east divide ended revolution fall berlin wall dissolution soviet union allowed european integration advance significantly european integration advanced institutionally since founding council europe significantly realisation european union eu represents today majority europe european union supranational political entity lie confederation federation based system european treaty eu originated western europe expanding eastward since dissolution soviet union majority member adopted common currency euro participate european single market custom union large bloc country schengen area also abolished internal border immigration control regular popular election take place every five year within eu considered secondlargest democratic election world india eu economy secondlargest world nominal gdp thirdlargest pppadjusted gdp etymology place name evros first used ancient greek refer northernmost province bear name today principal river – evros today maritsa – flow fertile valley thrace also called europe term meant continent classical greek mythology europa ancient greek εὐρώπη eurṓpē phoenician princess one view name derives ancient greek element εὐρύς eurús wide broad ὤψ ōps gen ὠπός ōpós eye face countena
Finke Desert Race,"The Finke Desert Race is an off-road, multi-terrain two-day race for motorbikes, cars, buggies and quad bikes through desert country from Alice Springs to the small and remote community of Aputula (called Finke until the 1980s) in Australia's Northern Territory. The race is usually held each year on the King's Birthday long weekend in June. ""Finke"", as it is commonly known, is one of the biggest annual sporting events in the Northern Territory.

Track
Encompassing about 229km each way, the Finke Desert Race travels through many properties on its way to end up crossing the Finke River just north of Aputula. The track is divided into five sections:

Start/Finish Line to Deep Well (61 km)
Deep Well to Rodinga (31 km)
Rodinga to Bundooma (43 km)
Bundooma to Mount Squires (45 km)
Mount Squires to Finke (49 km)

History
The race started in 1976 as a ""there and back"" challenge for a group of local motorbike riders to race from Alice Springs Inland Dragway to the Finke River and return. After the success of this initial ride, the Finke Desert Race has been held annually on the King's Birthday long weekend ever since. The race is run along sections of the Central Australia Railway along a winding corrugated track, which goes through the outback terrain of red dirt, sand, spinifex, mulga and desert oaks. Even though the railway line was realigned and rebuilt in the early 1980s, with the old tracks being pulled up, the race continues along its original course.
While originally the Finke was only a bike race, its increasing popularity saw the introduction of cars and off-road buggies in 1988. A rivalry developed between the two and four wheelers, as the buggies were keen to claim the ""King of the Desert"" title. For eleven consecutive years the bikes were too quick for the cars despite the gap constantly narrowing. Finally in 1999, a buggy returned home first to claim the honour, with the bikes winning back the title in 2000 and 2001. From 2002 until 2004 the buggies held onto the ""King of the Desert"" title. In 2005 the title was changed to see two ""Kings of the Desert"", one for the cars and one for bikes, each picking up $10,000 for their effort. The last bike to beat the cars time was Michael Vroom in 2001 on his Honda CR500.

COVID-19 impact
The 2020 race was cancelled for the first time in the event's history due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This cost the economy of Alice Springs about $8 million. In 2021 about 200 Victorian competitors, plus race officials, were unable to attend when the Northern Territory classed all of Victoria as a hot spot after the state entered its fourth lockdown.

2021 fatal crash
During the 2021 race, a vehicle struck spectators just 35 kilometres short of the finish line. One person was killed and two others, including the driver, were hospitalised. The remainder of the event was subsequently cancelled, meaning the bike race was not completed. The buggy category had already been won earlier that morning. The winning racer, Toby Price, had previously won in the bike category six times, and therefore became the first person to have won in both the bike and buggy categories.

Asia,"Asia (  AY-zhə, UK also  AY-shə) is the largest continent in the world by both land area and population. It covers an area of more than 44 million square kilometres, about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8% of Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilisations. Its 4.7 billion people constitute roughly 60% of the world's population.
Asia shares the landmass of Eurasia with Europe, and of Afro-Eurasia with both Europe and Africa. In general terms, it is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, on the south by the Indian Ocean, and on the north by the Arctic Ocean. The border of Asia with Europe is a historical and cultural construct, as there is no clear physical and geographical separation between them. A commonly accepted division places Asia to the east of the Suez Canal separating it from Africa; and to the east of the Turkish straits, the Ural Mountains and Ural River, and to the south of the Caucasus Mountains and the Caspian and Black seas, separating it from Europe.
Since the concept of Asia derives from the term for the eastern region from a European perspective, Asia is the remaining vast area of Eurasia minus Europe. Therefore, Asia is a region where various independent cultures coexist rather than sharing a single culture, and the boundary between Europe is somewhat arbitrary and has moved since its first conception in classical antiquity. The division of Eurasia into two continents reflects East–West cultural differences, some of which vary on a spectrum.
China and India traded places as the largest economies in the world from 1 to 1800 CE. China was a major economic power for much of recorded history, with the highest GDP per capita until 1500. The Silk Road became the main east–west trading route in the Asian hinterlands while the Straits of Malacca stood as a major sea route. Asia has exhibited economic dynamism as well as robust population growth during the 20th century, but overall population growth has since fallen. Asia was the birthplace of most of the world's mainstream religions including Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, Hinduism, Islam, Jainism, Judaism, Sikhism, Taoism, Zoroastrianism, and many other religions.
Asia varies greatly across and within its regions with regard to ethnic groups, cultures, environments, economics, historical ties, and government systems. It also has a mix of many different climates ranging from the equatorial south via the hot deserts in parts of West Asia, Central Asia and South Asia, temperate areas in the east and the continental centre to vast subarctic and polar areas in North Asia.

Etymology
The term ""Asia"" is believed to originate in the Bronze Age toponym Assuwa (Hittite: 𒀸𒋗𒉿, romanized: aš-šu-wa) which originally referred only to a portion of northwestern Anatolia. The term appears in Hittite records recounting how a confederation of Assuwan states including Troy unsuccessfully rebelled against the Hittite king Tudhaliya I around 1400 BCE. Roughly contemporary Linear B documents contain the term aswia (Mycenaean Greek: 𐀀𐀯𐀹𐀊, romanized: a-si-wi-ja), seemingly in reference to captives from the same area.

Herodotus used the term in reference to Anatolia and the territory of the Achaemenid Empire, in contrast to Greece and Egypt. He reports that Greeks assumed that Asia was named after the wife of Prometheus, but that Lydians say it was named after Asies, son of Cotys, who passed the name on to a tribe at Sardis. In Greek mythology, ""Asia"" (Ἀσία or Ἀσίη) was the name of a ""Nymph or Titan goddess of Lydia"". The Iliad (attributed by the ancient Greeks to Homer) mentions two Phrygians in the Trojan War named Asios (literally 'Asian'); and also a marsh or lowland containing a marsh in Lydia as ασιος.
The term was later adopted by the Romans, who used it in reference to the province of Asia, located in western Anatolia. One of the first writers to use Asia as a name of the whole continent was Pliny.

Definition
Asia–Europe boundary
The threefold division of the Old World into Africa, Asia, and Europe has been in use since the 6th century BCE, due to Greek geographers such as Anaximander and Hecataeus. Anaximander placed the boundary between Asia and Europe along the Phasis River (now the Rioni) in Georgia of Caucasus (from its mouth by Poti on the Black Sea coast, through the Surami Pass and along the Kura River to the Caspian Sea), a convention still followed by Herodotus in the 5th century BCE. During the Hellenistic period, this convention was revised, and the boundary between Europe and Asia was now considered to be the Tanais (the modern Don River). This is the convention used by Roman era authors such as Posidonius, Strabo and Ptolemy.
The border between Asia and Europe was historically defined by European academics.

Comedy of menace,"Comedy of menace is the body of plays written by David Campton, Nigel Dennis, N. F. Simpson, and Harold Pinter.  The term was coined by drama critic Irving Wardle, who borrowed it from the subtitle of Campton's play The Lunatic View: A Comedy of Menace, in reviewing Pinter's and Campton's plays in Encore in 1958.  (Campton's subtitle Comedy of Menace is a jocular play-on-words derived from comedy of manners—menace being manners pronounced with somewhat of an English accent.)

Background
Citing Wardle's original publications in Encore magazine (1958), Susan Hollis Merritt points out that in ""Comedy of Menace"" Wardle ""first applies this label to Pinter's work … describ[ing] Pinter as one of 'several playwrights who have been tentatively lumped together as the ""non-naturalists"" or ""abstractionists"" ' (28)"" (Merritt 225).  His article ""Comedy of Menace,"" Merritt continues,

centers on The Birthday Party because it is the only play of Pinter's that Wardle had seen [and reviewed] at the time, yet he speculates on the basis of ""descriptions of [Pinter's] other plays, 'The Room' and 'The Dumb Waiter', [that Pinter] is a writer dogged by one image—the womb"" (33).  Mentioning the acknowledged ""literary influences"" on Pinter's work—""Beckett, Kafka and American gangster films""—Wardle argues that "" 'The Birthday Party' exemplifies the type of comic menace which gave rise to this article."" (225)
In ""Comedy of Menace"", as Merritt observes, on the basis of his experience of The Birthday Party and others' accounts of the other two plays, Wardle proposes that ""Comedy enables the committed agents and victims of destruction to come on and off duty; to joke about the situation while oiling a revolver; to display absurd or endearing features behind their masks of implacable resolution; to meet … in paper hats for a game of blind man's buff""; he suggests how ""menace"" in Pinter's plays ""stands for something more substantial: destiny,"" and that destiny, ""handled in this way—not as an austere exercise in classicism, but as an incurable disease which one forgets about most of the time and whose lethal reminders may take the form of a joke—is an apt dramatic motif for an age of conditioned behaviour in which orthodox man is a willing collaborator in his own destruction"" (Wardle, ""Comedy of Menace"" 33; rpt. in The Encore Reader 91).
""Just two years later"" (1960), however, Wardle retracted ""Comedy of Menace"" in his review of The Caretaker, stating: ""On the strength of 'The Birthday Party' and the pair of one-acters, I rashly applied the phrase 'comedy of menace' to Pinter's writing.  I now take it back"" (""There's Music"" 130, as qtd. in Merritt 225–26).
After Wardle's retraction of comedy of menace as he had applied it to Pinter's writing, Pinter himself also occasionally disavowed it and questioned its relevance to his work (as he  also did with his own offhand but apt statement that his plays are about ""the weasel under the cocktail cabinet"").  For example, in December 1971, in his interview with Pinter about Old Times, Mel Gussow recalled that ""After The Homecoming [Pinter] said that [he] 'couldn't any longer stay in the room with this bunch of people who opened doors and came in and went out.  Landscape and Silence [the two short poetic memory plays that were written between The Homecoming and Old Times] are in a very different form.  There isn't any menace at all.' ""  Later, when Gussow asked Pinter to expand on his view that he had ""tired"" of ""menace"", Pinter added: ""when I said that I was tired of menace, I was using a word that I didn't coin.  I never thought of menace myself.  It was called 'comedy of menace' quite a long time ago [1958].  I never stuck categories on myself, or on any of us [playwrights].  But if what I understand the word menace to mean is certain elements that I have employed in the past in the shape of a particular play, then I don't think it's worthy of much more exploration"" (Gussow, Conversations with Pinter 18, 24).
Despite Wardle's retraction of comedy of menace (and Pinter's later qualifications), Comedy of menace and comedies of menace caught on and have been prevalent since the late 1950s in advertisements and in critical accounts, notices, and reviews to describe Pinter's early plays and some of his later work as well.  As Merritt points out, among other examples of critics' usage of this and similar categories of Pinter's work, after Gussow's 1971 ""conversation"" with Pinter, ""Though he echoes Wardle's concept, Gussow seems to avoid using comedy of menace when reviewing the CSC Repertory Theatre's 1988 production of The Birthday Party.  While still emphasizing Pinter's 'terrors' and the 'shiver beneath the laughter,' Gussow describes the play as 'a play of intrigue, with an underlying motif of betrayal' … [and] [Bernard F.] Dukore calls the play 'a comedy (of menace or otherwise)' … (Merritt 10).

Desert greening,"Desert greening is the process of afforestation or revegetation of deserts for ecological restoration (biodiversity), sustainable farming and forestry, but also for reclamation of natural water systems and other ecological systems that support life. The term ""desert greening"" is intended to apply to both cold and hot arid and semi-arid deserts (see Köppen climate classification system). It does not apply to ice capped or permafrost regions.  It pertains to roughly 32 million square kilometres of land. Deserts span all seven continents of the Earth and make up nearly a fifth of the Earth's landmass, areas that recently have been increasing in size. 
As some of the deserts expand and global temperatures increase, the different methods of desert greening may provide a possible response. Planting suitable flora in deserts has a range of environmental benefits from carbon sequestration to providing habitat for  desert fauna to generating employment opportunities to creation of habitable areas for local communities.
The prevention of land desertification is one of 17 Sustainable Development Goals outlined by the United Nations. Desert greening is a process that aims to not only combat desertification but to foster an environment where plants can create a sustainable environment for all forms of life while preserving its integrity.

Desert greening techniques
When establishing or re-establishing vegetation in desert ecosystems there are many factors to consider before implementing a specific strategy. It is important to account for factors such as the geographical location of the area, amount of annual precipitation, average temperature, soil quality, nutrient availability, native plant and animal life, along with the human impact when aiming to restore a degraded or disrupted desert biome.

Planting
Planting strategies in the desert are different from conventional planting practices, especially in the initial stages. Deserts are regions in which annual precipitation is considerably less than the evaporation, making it difficult for plants and animals that are not specialized to the biome to survive. One of the ways to ensure the success of the plant life is that prior to being planted in the desert, plants are often grown first in greenhouses, allowing for root systems to develop. Often the plant species that are planted in desert regions are those that are capable of surviving on limited water and able to withstand the sun's direct rays. However, deserts also vary, with some being hot and dry and others being semiarid, and plants that may survive in a coastal desert might not be able to endure the considerably higher temperatures of hot and dry deserts. Therefore, when planting in deserts as an effort to restore the ecosystem or to create a greener space it is important that the vegetation being planted is suitable to the desert in which it is being planted. Utilizing pioneer desert species like the Acamptopappus shockleyi or Lepidium fremontii which are native to the Mojave Desert, and halophytes such as Salicornia contribute positively to desert greening efforts. Planting of trees which store water, inhibit soil erosion through wind, raise water from underlying aquifers, reduce evaporation after a rain, attract animals (and thereby fertility through feces), and they can cause more rain to fall (by temperature reduction and other effects), if the planted area is large enough. Another method of introducing or re-introducing vegetation to deserts is through seeding which involves the scattering of seeds either manually or aerially depending upon the size of the region undergoing vegetation efforts. Using seeding as a desert greening technique on a large scale requires a longer time for the ecosystem to recover and for the vegetation to establish itself as was seen in the Mu Us Desert. Additionally, there are potential downsides due to the environmental vulnerability and predation by desert animals putting the success of this technique at risk.

Landscaping and green infrastructure
With the growth of human population in urban areas that are located close to deserts, ecoscaping has become an important strategy when designing and building infrastructure. Using the National Tree Benefit Calculator software it was established that if Acacia tortilis, Ziziphus spina-christi, and Phoenix dactylifera were planted in a desert city like Doha, this would yield a host of environmental benefits along with economic gains including carbon sequestration, air pollution reduction, lowering of the urban heat index, prevention of storm water runoff and increase in property values. As global temperatures increase, environmental impacts are considerably greater in dry regions with reduced precipitation levels which are vulnerable to desertification. Some of the effects that are beneficial for desert-greening which trees offer can also be provided by buildings that have incorporated architectural elements that allow them to shade expos",Deserts,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_greening,1,desert greening process afforestation revegetation desert ecological restoration biodiversity sustainable farming forestry also reclamation natural water system ecological system support life term desert greening intended apply cold hot arid semiarid desert see köppen climate classification system apply ice capped permafrost region pertains roughly million square kilometre land desert span seven continent earth make nearly fifth earth landmass area recently increasing size desert expand global temperature increase different method desert greening may provide possible response planting suitable flora desert range environmental benefit carbon sequestration providing habitat desert fauna generating employment opportunity creation habitable area local community prevention land desertification one sustainable development goal outlined united nation desert greening process aim combat desertification foster environment plant create sustainable environment form life preserving integrity desert greening technique establishing reestablishing vegetation desert ecosystem many factor consider implementing specific strategy important account factor geographical location area amount annual precipitation average temperature soil quality nutrient availability native plant animal life along human impact aiming restore degraded disrupted desert biome planting planting strategy desert different conventional planting practice especially initial stage desert region annual precipitation considerably less evaporation making difficult plant animal specialized biome survive one way ensure success plant life prior planted desert plant often grown first greenhouse allowing root system develop often plant specie planted desert region capable surviving limited water able withstand sun direct ray however desert also vary hot dry others semiarid plant may survive coastal desert might able endure considerably higher temperature hot dry desert therefore planting desert effort restore ecosystem create greener space important vegetation planted suitable desert planted utilizing pioneer desert specie like acamptopappus shockleyi lepidium fremontii native mojave desert halophyte salicornia contribute positively desert greening effort planting tree store water inhibit soil erosion wind raise water underlying aquifer reduce evaporation rain attract animal thereby fertility feces cause rain fall temperature reduction effect planted area large enough another method introducing reintroducing vegetation desert seeding involves scattering seed either manually aerially depending upon size region undergoing vegetation effort using seeding desert greening technique large scale requires longer time ecosystem recover vegetation establish seen mu u desert additionally potential downside due environmental vulnerability predation desert animal putting success technique risk landscaping green infrastructure growth human population urban area located close desert ecoscaping become important strategy designing building infrastructure using national tree benefit calculator software established acacia tortilis ziziphus spinachristi phoenix dactylifera planted desert city like doha would yield host environmental benefit along economic gain including carbon sequestration air pollution reduction lowering urban heat index prevention storm water runoff increase property value global temperature increase environmental impact considerably greater dry region reduced precipitation level vulnerable desertification effect beneficial desertgreening tree offer also provided building incorporated architectural element allow shade expo
Environmental flow,"Environmental flows describe the quantity, timing, and quality of water flows required to sustain freshwater and estuarine ecosystems and the human livelihoods and well being that depend on these ecosystems. In the Indian context river flows required for cultural and spiritual needs assumes significance. Through implementation of environmental flows, water managers strive to achieve a flow regime, or pattern, that provides for human uses and maintains the essential processes required to support healthy river ecosystems. Environmental flows do not necessarily require restoring the natural, pristine flow patterns that would occur absent human development, use, and diversion but, instead, are intended to produce a broader set of values and benefits from rivers than from management focused strictly on water supply, energy, recreation, or flood control.
Rivers are parts of integrated systems that include floodplains and riparian corridors. Collectively these systems provide a large suite of benefits. However, the world's rivers are increasingly being altered through the construction of dams, diversions, and levees. More than half of the world's large rivers are dammed, a figure that continues to increase. Almost 1,000 dams are planned or under construction in South America and 50 new dams are planned on China's Yangtze River alone.  Dams and other river structures change the downstream flow patterns and consequently affect water quality, temperature, sediment movement and deposition, fish and wildlife, and the livelihoods of people who depend on healthy river ecosystems. Environmental flows seek to maintain these river functions while at the same time providing for traditional offstream benefits.

Evolution of environmental flow concepts and recognition
From the turn of the 20th century through the 1960s, water management in developed nations focused largely on maximizing flood protection, water supplies, and hydropower generation. During the 1970s, the ecological and economic effects of these projects prompted scientists to seek ways to modify dam operations to maintain certain fish species. The initial focus was on determining the minimum flow necessary to preserve an individual species, such as trout, in a river. Environmental flows evolved from this concept of ""minimum flows"" and, later, ""instream flows"", which emphasized the need to keep water within waterways.
By the 1990s, scientists came to realize that the biological and social systems supported by rivers are too complicated to be summarized by a single minimum flow requirement. Since the 1990s, restoring and maintaining more comprehensive environmental flows has gained increasing support, as has the capability of scientists and engineers to define these flows to maintain the full spectrum of riverine species, processes and services. Furthermore, implementation has evolved from dam reoperation to an integration of all aspects of water management, including groundwater and surface water diversions and return flows, as well as land use and storm water management. The science to support regional-scale environmental flow determination and management has likewise advanced.
In a global survey of water specialists undertaken in 2003 to gauge perceptions of environmental flow, 88% of the 272 respondents agreed that the concept is essential for sustainably managing water resources and meeting the long-term needs of people. In 2007, the Brisbane Declaration on Environmental Flows was endorsed by more than 750 practitioners from more than 50 countries. The declaration announced an official pledge to work together to protect and restore the world's rivers and lakes. By 2010, many countries throughout the world had adopted environmental flow policies, although their implementation remains a challenge.

Examples
One effort currently underway to restore environmental flows is the Sustainable Rivers Project, a collaboration between The Nature Conservancy (TNC) and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), which is the largest water manager in the United States. Since 2002, TNC and the USACE have been working to define and implement environmental flows by altering the operations of USACE dams in 8 rivers across 12 states. Dam reoperation to release environmental flows, in combination with floodplain restoration, has in some instances increased the water available for hydropower production while reducing flood risk.
Arizona's Bill Williams River, flowing downstream of Alamo Dam, is one of the rivers featured in the Sustainable Rivers Project. Having discussed modifying dam operations since the early 1990s, local stakeholders began to work with TNC and USACE in 2005 to identify specific strategies for improving the ecological health and biodiversity of the river basin downstream from the dam. Scientists compiled the best available information and worked together to define environmental flows for the Bill Williams River.

Estuary freshwater inflow,"Estuary freshwater inflow is the freshwater that flows into an estuary. 
Other types of environmental flows include instream flow, the freshwater water flowing in rivers or streams, and estuary outflow, the outflow from an estuary to the ocean.

Estuaries
Freshwater inflow: Freshwater flows into an estuary and mixes with the marine water of the estuarine ecosystem. The mixing of freshwater inflow and the marine water of the estuarine ecosystem occurs spatially and temporally from climatic influences including tidal action, seasonal variability and storms. Mixing is affected by the amount of estuarine system. The tides and the volume of the receiving estuary govern the volume of seawater. Tides are defined as the periodic rise and fall of the surface of the sea along the coast that are driven by the gravitational pull of the moon and of the sun. Although estuaries are influenced by the tides, they are often somewhat protected from storms and tidal action by buffers further offshore including barrier islands and peninsulas.
The low-salinity conditions of the marine water are created when freshwater mixes with the saltwater of the estuarine system. Average [salinity] for freshwater is around 0.5 parts per thousand (ppt) whereas average salinity of the ocean is 35 ppt. The salinity will not be consistent throughout a particular estuary and will be differ from one estuary to the next but its level will range from 0.5 ppt to 35 ppt. In estuaries, primary producers take up nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. Freshwater inflows carry estuaries, replenishing the stock for phytoplankton use. Sediments settling out and form banks, offshore peninsulas, and barrier islands that protect the estuary from strong tidal action and currents. The sediment also supports beaches and provision the inter-tidal wetlands. Organic material delivered to estuaries by freshwater inflows the primary energy source for organisms living in the estuary. Estuarine ecosystems need freshwater inflow to maintain their productivity, or to continue to produce biomass.
Estuarine ecosystems are fundamentally important and necessary to protect through the management of freshwater inflow because of the many ecosystem services they produce. An ecosystem service is something provided by nature that is of value to humans. Estuarine ecosystems are among the most productive ecosystems on the planet. Estuaries house such species as the blue crab, red fish, flounder, spotted seatrout, and many others for some point of the species’ life cycle. Marine habitats, such as those found in estuarine ecosystems, are valued at providing an estimated US14$ trillion worth of ecosystem goods and services annually, or 43% of the global total. Some economically important estuarine habitats include tidal flats, salt marshes, sea grass beds, oyster reefs, and mangroves. This is why estuaries are important to protect and conserve.

Global change
Global changes caused largely by anthropogenic influences, or human impacts, are altering the amount of freshwater inflows to estuaries. Humans are diverting water from rivers and streams, decreasing the amount of flows making it to estuarine ecosystems. Since the 1960s dewatering, or removal of water from streams and rivers, has doubled and around 60% of the Earth’s runoff is captured. The removal of freshwater from rivers and streams for anthropogenic use before it reaches the coast is having a negative impact on many estuaries. Half of the world’s major cities are within 50 km of the coast, and coastal populations are 2.6 times denser than those further inland. Technological advances in the collection of freshwater is continually improving, further straining available freshwater resources. As the human population grows and the strain on water resources continues, the ability to effectively manage freshwater inflows into estuaries is becoming a priority worldwide.

Dewatering
Changes in freshwater inflow have resulted in losses of habitat, biodiversity, and productivity. Studies also found changes in bioindicator species community’s biomass correlated with changing freshwater inflows, which indicates secondary production changes with altered inflows. These studies suggest the health of the estuary depends on freshwater inflow.
Below is an example of how an upstream human diversion creates cascading effects downstream.

Freshwater inflow management
Many different methodologies aimed at freshwater inflow management to maintain an estuary have been implemented throughout the world. Studies are aimed at determining the freshwater inflow amount necessary to maintain an estuarine ecosystem. One common methodology implemented in studies in several U.S. states including Texas, Florida, and California is to indirectly link estuarine resources (i.e. integrity- species composition, biomass, diversity; function- primary production, secondary production, nutrient recycling; sustainability- habitats, valued resources, ecosystem services) t",Rivers,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estuary_freshwater_inflow,1,estuary freshwater inflow freshwater flow estuary type environmental flow include instream flow freshwater water flowing river stream estuary outflow outflow estuary ocean estuary freshwater inflow freshwater flow estuary mix marine water estuarine ecosystem mixing freshwater inflow marine water estuarine ecosystem occurs spatially temporally climatic influence including tidal action seasonal variability storm mixing affected amount estuarine system tide volume receiving estuary govern volume seawater tide defined periodic rise fall surface sea along coast driven gravitational pull moon sun although estuary influenced tide often somewhat protected storm tidal action buffer offshore including barrier island peninsula lowsalinity condition marine water created freshwater mix saltwater estuarine system average salinity freshwater around part per thousand ppt whereas average salinity ocean ppt salinity consistent throughout particular estuary differ one estuary next level range ppt ppt estuary primary producer take nutrient nitrogen phosphorus freshwater inflow carry estuary replenishing stock phytoplankton use sediment settling form bank offshore peninsula barrier island protect estuary strong tidal action current sediment also support beach provision intertidal wetland organic material delivered estuary freshwater inflow primary energy source organism living estuary estuarine ecosystem need freshwater inflow maintain productivity continue produce biomass estuarine ecosystem fundamentally important necessary protect management freshwater inflow many ecosystem service produce ecosystem service something provided nature value human estuarine ecosystem among productive ecosystem planet estuary house specie blue crab red fish flounder spotted seatrout many others point specie ’ life cycle marine habitat found estuarine ecosystem valued providing estimated u trillion worth ecosystem good service annually global total economically important estuarine habitat include tidal flat salt marsh sea grass bed oyster reef mangrove estuary important protect conserve global change global change caused largely anthropogenic influence human impact altering amount freshwater inflow estuary human diverting water river stream decreasing amount flow making estuarine ecosystem since dewatering removal water stream river doubled around earth ’ runoff captured removal freshwater river stream anthropogenic use reach coast negative impact many estuary half world ’ major city within km coast coastal population time denser inland technological advance collection freshwater continually improving straining available freshwater resource human population grows strain water resource continues ability effectively manage freshwater inflow estuary becoming priority worldwide dewatering change freshwater inflow resulted loss habitat biodiversity productivity study also found change bioindicator specie community ’ biomass correlated changing freshwater inflow indicates secondary production change altered inflow study suggest health estuary depends freshwater inflow example upstream human diversion creates cascading effect downstream freshwater inflow management many different methodology aimed freshwater inflow management maintain estuary implemented throughout world study aimed determining freshwater inflow amount necessary maintain estuarine ecosystem one common methodology implemented study several u state including texas florida california indirectly link estuarine resource ie integrity specie composition biomass diversity function primary production secondary production nutrient recycling sustainability habitat valued resource ecosystem service
Fort Monmouth,"Fort Monmouth is a former installation of the Department of the Army in Monmouth County, New Jersey and the site of a major upcoming Netflix film production campus, alongside a variety of other redevelopment. The site is surrounded by the communities of Eatontown, Tinton Falls and Oceanport, New Jersey. It is about five miles (8.0 km) from the Atlantic Ocean and about a 52 mi (84 km) drive south of Manhattan.

Location and background
The fort is about a 10-minute drive from Seven Presidents Oceanfront Park and from Long Branch Beach on the Jersey Shore. The post covered nearly 1,126 acres (4.56 km2) of land, from the Shrewsbury River on the east, to Route 35 on the west; this area was referred to as 'Main Post.' A separate area (Camp Charles Wood) to the west included post housing, a golf course, and additional office and laboratory facilities.
A rail line, owned by Conrail, ran through Camp Charles Wood and out to Naval Weapons Station Earle. The post was like a small town, including a Post Exchange (PX), health clinic, gas station and other amenities. From the September 11 attacks in 2001 to 2017, the post was not open to the public to drive through and was closed to all but authorized personnel. The main road through the fort was reopened to the public in 2017.
The post was home to several units of the U.S. Army Materiel Command and offices of the Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) that research and manage Command and Control, Communications, Computing, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) capabilities and related technology, as well as an interservice organization designed to coordinate C4ISR, an academic preparatory school, an explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) unit, a garrison services unit, an Army health clinic, and a Veterans Administration health clinic. Other agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Federal Emergency Management Agency and the National Security Agency, had presences on the post.
The post was selected for closure by the Base Realignment and Closure Commission in 2005. Most Army functions and personnel were required to be moved to Army facilities in Maryland—such as Aberdeen Proving Ground—and Ohio by 2011. The post officially closed on September 15, 2011. However, it was temporarily reopened in December 2012 for the evacuation of the borough of Paulsboro's residents following a freight train derailment on November 30, 2012.

Netflix Studios Fort Monmouth
In October 2022, Netflix signed to build a major ""state-of-the-art"" production complex, Netflix Studios Fort Monmouth, on a nearly 300-acre portion of the former army installation, known as Mega Parcel. The state has seen an influx of film production and soundstage construction in light of New Jersey's newly expanded film production tax credit program. As of March 2024, Netflix had moved into site plan development.
The Netflix contract was facilitated by the Fort Monmouth Economic Revitalization Authority (FMERA), the board that oversees redevelopment of the fort. The property was purchased for $55 million, with a projected investment of $850 million into construction. It is estimated to generate an estimated 1500 permanent jobs for the area. 
On December 21, 2022, Governor Phil Murphy described Netflix's purchase of the Mega Parcel as a ""transformative investment” for New Jersey. Eatontown's mayor Anthony Talerico commented on the potential economic growth the project will bring to the surrounding area. Oceanport's mayor Jay Coffey praised the project and cited ""social revitalization"" that Netflix would bring to Fort Monmouth. Public opinion from Oceanport and Eatontown residents was largely positive. It is projected that this production campus will accrue an estimated maximum of $4.6 billion in revenue over the next 20 years.
The proposed redevelopment project will be located adjacent to major public transportation outlets such as NJ Transit lines, the Garden State Parkway, and New Jersey State Rt. 35. Estimations for the size of the planned campus are between 180,000 and 480,000 square feet. The development will contain 12 sound stages, various production buildings, and office buildings. Governor Phil Murphy wrote Netflix a letter to petition them to purchase land in New Jersey over the original property in Georgia due to Georgia's controversial changes in voter laws.
On February 21, 2024, FMERA unanimously approved an amendment to create zoning for the project, allowing Netflix to move ahead with its plans for the complex.

Boundaries between the continents,"Determining the boundaries between the continents is generally a matter of geographical convention. Several slightly different conventions are in use. The number of continents is most commonly considered seven (in English-speaking countries) but may range as low as four when Afro-Eurasia and the Americas are both considered as single continents. An island can be considered to be associated with a given continent by either lying on the continent's adjacent continental shelf (e.g. Singapore, the British Isles) or being a part of a microcontinent on the same principal tectonic plate (e.g. Madagascar and Seychelles). An island can also be entirely oceanic while still being associated with a continent by geology (e.g. Bermuda, the Australian Indian Ocean Territories) or by common geopolitical convention (e.g. Ascension Island, the South Sandwich Islands). Another example is the grouping into Oceania of the Pacific Islands with Australia and Zealandia.
There are three overland boundaries subject to definition:

between Africa and Asia (dividing Afro-Eurasia into Africa and Eurasia): at the Isthmus of Suez;
between Asia and Europe (dividing Eurasia): along the Turkish straits, the Caucasus, and the Urals and the Ural River (historically also north of the Caucasus, along the Kuma–Manych Depression or along the Don River);
between North America and South America (dividing the Americas): at some point on the Isthmus of Panama, with the most common demarcation in atlases and other sources following the Darién Mountains watershed along the Colombia–Panama border where the isthmus meets the South American continent (see Darién Gap).
While today the isthmus between Asia and Africa is navigable via the Suez Canal, and that between North and South America via the Panama Canal, these artificial channels are not generally accepted as continent-defining boundaries in themselves. The Suez Canal happens to traverse the Isthmus of Suez between the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, dividing Africa and Asia. The continental boundaries are considered to be within the very narrow land connections joining the continents.
The remaining boundaries concern the association of islands and archipelagos with specific continents, notably:

the delineation between Africa, Asia, and Europe in the Mediterranean Sea;
the delineation between Asia and Europe in the Arctic Ocean;
the delineation between Europe and North America in the North Atlantic Ocean;
the delineation between North and South America in the Caribbean Sea;
the delineation of Antarctica from Africa, Australia, and South America in the Indian, South Pacific, and South Atlantic oceans, respectively (referred to collectively by some geographers as the Southern Ocean or the Antarctic Ocean);
the delineation of Asia from Australia in the Ceram Sea, Arafura Sea, Timor Sea, Halmahera Sea, and the Wallacean region of the Indonesian Archipelago
the delineation of Asia from North America in the North Pacific Ocean.

Africa and Asia
Historically in Greco-Roman geography, ""Africa"" meant Ancient Libya, and its eastern extent was taken to be around Marmarica, at the Catabathmus Magnus. This was not considered to be a continent. As wider knowledge of geography developed, the shape of the African landmass (and Egypt's ""natural"" inclusion in that landmass) became apparent. In 1806, William George Browne still titled his travelogue Travels in Africa, Egypt, and Syria. Similarly, James Bruce in 1835 published Travels through part of Africa, Syria, Egypt, and Arabia. On the other hand, as early as 1670 John Ogilby under the title Africa published ""an accurate Description of the Regions of Egypt, Barbary, Libya, and Billedulgerid, the Land of Negroes, Guinea, Æthiopia, and the Abyssines, with all the adjacent Islands, either in the Mediterranean, Atlantic, Southern, or Oriental Seas, belonging thereunto"".
The usual line taken to divide Africa from Asia today is at the Isthmus of Suez, the narrowest gap between the Mediterranean Sea and the Gulf of Suez, the route today followed by the Suez Canal. This makes the Sinai Peninsula geographically Asian, and Egypt a transcontinental country. Less than 2% of the Egyptian population live on the Sinai Peninsula, and hence Egypt, even though technically transcontinental, is usually considered an African country entirely and not partly Asian. But when discussing the geopolitical region of the Middle East and North Africa, Egypt is usually grouped with the Western Asian countries as part of the Middle East, while Egypt's western neighbor Libya is grouped with the remaining North African countries as the Maghreb. Both are members of the African Union. However, the geological boundary is located further to the east, along the Gulf of Aqaba and the Dead Sea Transform, with the Sinai Peninsula, Israel, Palestine, much of Lebanon and the coastal governorates of Syria being located on the African Plate.

Island,"An island or isle is a piece of land, distinct from a continent, completely surrounded by water. There are continental islands, which were formed by being split from a continent by plate tectonics, and oceanic islands, which have never been part of a continent. Oceanic islands can be formed from volcanic activity, grow into atolls from coral reefs, and form from sediment along shorelines, creating barrier islands. River islands can also form from sediment and debris in rivers. Artificial islands are those made by humans, including small rocky outcroppings built out of lagoons and large-scale land reclamation projects used for development.
Islands are host to diverse plant and animal life. Oceanic islands have the sea as a natural barrier to the introduction of new species, causing the species that do reach the island to evolve in isolation. Continental islands share animal and plant life with the continent they split from. Depending on how long ago the continental island formed, the life on that island may have diverged greatly from the mainland due to natural selection.
Humans have lived on and traveled between islands for thousands of years at a minimum. Some islands became host to humans due to a land bridge or a continental island splitting from the mainland, or by boat travel. In the far north or south some islands are joined by seasonal or glacial ice. Today, up to 10% of the world's population lives on islands. Islands are popular targets for tourism due to their perceived natural beauty, isolation, and unique cultures.
Islands became the target of colonization by Europeans, resulting in the majority of islands in the Pacific being put under European control. Decolonization has resulted in some but not all island nations becoming self-governing, with lasting effects related to industrialisation, invasive species, nuclear weapons testing, and tourism. Islands and island countries are threatened by climate change. Sea level rise threatens to submerge nations such as Maldives, the Marshall Islands, and Tuvalu completely. Increases in the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones can cause widespread destruction of infrastructure and animal habitats. Species that live exclusively on islands are some of those most threatened by extinction.

Definition
An island is an area of land surrounded by water on all sides that is distinct from a continent. There is no standard of size that distinguishes islands and continents. Continents have an accepted geological definition – they are the largest landmass of a particular tectonic plate. Islands can occur in any body of water, including lakes, rivers, seas. Low-tide elevations, areas of land that are not above the surface during a high tide, are generally not considered islands. Islands that have been bridged or otherwise joined to a mainland with land reclamation are sometimes considered ""de-islanded"", but not in every case.

Etymology
The word island derives from Middle English iland, from Old English igland (from ig or ieg, similarly meaning 'island' when used independently, and -land carrying its contemporary meaning. Old English ieg is actually a cognate of Swedish ö and German Aue, and more distantly related to Latin aqua (water).
The spelling of the word was modified in the 15th century because of a false etymology caused by an association with the Old French loanword isle, which itself comes from the Latin word insula.

Geology
Formation in oceans
Islands often are found in archipelagos or island chains, which are collections of islands. These chains are thought to form from volcanic hotspots, areas of the lithosphere where the mantle is hotter than the surrounding area. These hotspots would give rise to volcanoes whose lava would form the rock the islands are made of. For some islands, the movement of tectonic plates above stationary hotspots would form islands in a linear chain, with the islands further away from the hotspot being progressively older and more eroded, before disappearing under the sea entirely. An example is the Hawaiian Islands, with the oldest island being 25 million years old, and the youngest, Hawaii, still being an active volcano. However, not all island chains are formed this way. Some may be formed all at once by fractures in the tectonic plates themselves, simultaneously creating multiple islands. One supporting piece of evidence is that of the Line Islands, which are all estimated to be 8 million years old, rather than being different ages.
Other island chains form due to being separated from existing continents. The Japanese archipelago may have been separated from Eurasia due to seafloor spreading, a phenomenon where new oceanic crust is formed, pushing away older crust. Islands sitting on the continental shelf may be called continental islands. Other islands, like those that make up New Zealand, are what remains of continents that shrank and sunk beneath the sea. It was estimated that Zealandia, the continent-like area of c",Islands,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island,1,island isle piece land distinct continent completely surrounded water continental island formed split continent plate tectonics oceanic island never part continent oceanic island formed volcanic activity grow atoll coral reef form sediment along shoreline creating barrier island river island also form sediment debris river artificial island made human including small rocky outcropping built lagoon largescale land reclamation project used development island host diverse plant animal life oceanic island sea natural barrier introduction new specie causing specie reach island evolve isolation continental island share animal plant life continent split depending long ago continental island formed life island may diverged greatly mainland due natural selection human lived traveled island thousand year minimum island became host human due land bridge continental island splitting mainland boat travel far north south island joined seasonal glacial ice today world population life island island popular target tourism due perceived natural beauty isolation unique culture island became target colonization european resulting majority island pacific put european control decolonization resulted island nation becoming selfgoverning lasting effect related industrialisation invasive specie nuclear weapon testing tourism island island country threatened climate change sea level rise threatens submerge nation maldives marshall island tuvalu completely increase frequency intensity tropical cyclone cause widespread destruction infrastructure animal habitat specie live exclusively island threatened extinction definition island area land surrounded water side distinct continent standard size distinguishes island continent continent accepted geological definition – largest landmass particular tectonic plate island occur body water including lake river sea lowtide elevation area land surface high tide generally considered island island bridged otherwise joined mainland land reclamation sometimes considered deislanded every case etymology word island derives middle english iland old english igland ig ieg similarly meaning island used independently land carrying contemporary meaning old english ieg actually cognate swedish ö german aue distantly related latin aqua water spelling word modified th century false etymology caused association old french loanword isle come latin word insula geology formation ocean island often found archipelago island chain collection island chain thought form volcanic hotspot area lithosphere mantle hotter surrounding area hotspot would give rise volcano whose lava would form rock island made island movement tectonic plate stationary hotspot would form island linear chain island away hotspot progressively older eroded disappearing sea entirely example hawaiian island oldest island million year old youngest hawaii still active volcano however island chain formed way may formed fracture tectonic plate simultaneously creating multiple island one supporting piece evidence line island estimated million year old rather different age island chain form due separated existing continent japanese archipelago may separated eurasia due seafloor spreading phenomenon new oceanic crust formed pushing away older crust island sitting continental shelf may called continental island island like make new zealand remains continent shrank sunk beneath sea estimated zealandia continentlike area c
Electrostatic solitary wave,"In space physics, an electrostatic solitary wave (ESW) is a type of electromagnetic soliton occurring during short time scales (when compared to the general time scales of variations in the average electric field) in plasma. When a rapid change occurs in the electric field in a direction parallel to the orientation of the magnetic field, and this perturbation is caused by a unipolar or dipolar electric potential, it is classified as an ESW.
Since the creation of ESWs is largely associated with turbulent fluid interactions, some experiments use them to compare how chaotic a measured plasma's mixing is. As such, many studies which involve ESWs are centered around turbulence, chaos, instabilities, and magnetic reconnection.

History
The discovery of solitary waves in general is attributed to John Scott Russell in 1834, with their first mathematical conceptualization being finalized in 1871 by Joseph Boussinesq (and later refined and popularized by Lord Rayleigh in 1876). However, these observations and solutions were for oscillations of a physical medium (usually water), and not describing the behavior of non-particle waves (including electromagnetic waves). For solitary waves outside of media, which ESWs are classified asa, the first major framework was likely developed by Louis de Broglie in 1927, though his work on the subject was temporarily abandoned and was not completed until the 1950s.
Electrostatic structures were first observed near Earth's polar cusp by Donald Gurnett and Louis A. Frank using data from the Hawkeye 1 satellite in 1978. However, it is Michael Temerin, William Lotko, Forrest Mozer, and Keith Cernyb who are credited with the first observation of electrostatic solitary waves in Earth's magnetosphere in 1982. Since then, a wide variety of magnetospheric satellites have observed and documented ESWs, allowing for analysis of them and the surrounding plasma conditions.

Detection
Electrostatic solitary waves, by their nature, are a phenomenon occurring in the electric field of a plasma. As such, ESWs are technically detectable by any instrument that can measure changes to the electric field during a sufficiently short time window. However, since a given plasma's electric field can vary widely depending on the properties of the plasma and since ESWs occur in short time windows, detection of ESWs can require additional screening of the data in addition to the measurement of the electric field itself. One solution to this obstacle for detecting ESWs, implemented by NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission (MMS), is to use a digital signal processor to analyze the electric field data and isolate short-duration spikes as a candidate for an ESW. Though the following detection algorithm is specific to MMS, other ESW-detecting algorithms function on similar principles.
To detect an ESW, the data from a device measuring the electric field is sent to the digital signal processor. This data is analyzed across a short time window (in the case of MMS, 1 millisecond), taking both the average electric field magnitude and the largest electric field magnitude during that time window. If the peak field strength exceeds some multiple of the average field strength (4 times the field strength in MMS), then the time window is considered to contain an ESW. After this occurs, the ESW can be associated with the peak electric field strength and categorized accordingly. These algorithms vary in success at detection, since both the time window and detection multiplier are chosen by scientists based on the parameters they wish to detect. As such, these algorithms often have false positives and false negatives.

Interactions
One of the primary physical consequences of ESWs is their creation of electron phase-space holes, a type of structure which prevents low velocity electrons from remaining close to the source of the ESW. These phase-space holes, like the ESWs themselves, can travel stably through the surrounding plasma. Since most plasmas are overall electrically neutral, these phase-space holes often end up behaving as a positive pseudoparticle.
In general, in order to form an electron phase-space hole, the electric potential energy associated with the ESW's potential needs to exceed the kinetic energy of electrons in the plasma (behavior analogous to potential hills). Research has shown that one possible set of situations where this occurs naturally are kinetic instabilities. One observed example of this is the increased occurrence of these holes near Earth's bow shock and magnetopause, where the incoming solar wind collides with Earth's magnetosphere to produce large amounts of turbulence in the plasma.

Forms

Combine painting,"A combine painting or Combine is an artwork that incorporates elements of both painting and sculpture. Items attached to paintings might include three-dimensional everyday objects such as clothing or furniture, as well as printed matter including photographs or newspaper clippings. 
The term is most closely associated with the artwork of American artist Robert Rauschenberg (1925–2008) who coined the phrase Combine to describe his own artworks that explore the  boundary between art and the everyday world. By placing them in the context of art, he endowed a new significance to ordinary objects. These cross-medium creations challenged the doctrine of medium specificity mentioned by modernist art critic Clement Greenberg. 
American artist Frank Stella created a large body of paintings in the late 1950s that recall the Combines of Robert Rauschenberg. In these works, Stella juxtaposed a wide variety of surfaces and materials, a process which led to Stella's later sculpture of the 21st century.

Rauschenberg's Combines
The reception of Rauschenberg’s Combines has been varied throughout their history. Paul Schimmel of the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art described Rauschenberg's Combine paintings as ""some of the most influential, poetic and revolutionary works in the history of American art."" They have also been called ""ramshackle hybrids between painting and sculpture, stage prop and three-dimensional scrap-book assemblage"" by The Guardian's critic Adrian Searle.
In reviews of the 2019 Whitney Biennial, critics highlighted Robert Rauschenberg as precedent for many of the contemporary artworks included. Artist Xaviera Simmons, however, pointed out that these critics did not go far enough to look into Rauschenberg's own precedents; she pointed to African American artists working with found objects in the Southern United States — a likely example for Rauschenberg who was raised in Port Arthur, Texas. In The Art Newspaper, Simmons wrote, “To mention the overarching theme of this iteration of the Whitney Biennial as linked to Robert Rauschenberg’s legacy, for example, without breaking down his connection as a Texan and his probable viewing of the assemblages he must have seen by Black American artists—descendants of slavery—in the rural South is actually preposterous. It does us all an educational disservice and disconnects a lineage and an impetus that is home-grown American. The wonder of Rauschenberg more than likely would not exist without the trauma of the American, disenfranchised rural landscape.”

In his own work, the artist Jasper Johns used similar techniques as those seen in Rauschenberg’s Combines. For example, in a painting, titled Fool’s House (1964), Johns affixed a broom onto his canvas. This possible inspiration from Rauschenberg was likely due to the close artistic and romantic relationship between the two artists. They met for the first time in 1953. Early on, to support their artistic careers, they collaborated on commercial projects, such as window displays for upscale retailers including Tiffany's and Bonwit Teller in Manhattan. As they both progressed in their artistic practices, they had studios in the same building and shared ideas about art and life on a daily basis from 1954 to 1961.
Examples of Rauschenberg's Combine paintings include Bed (1955), Canyon (1959), and the free-standing Monogram (1955–1959).  Critic John Perreault wrote ""The Combines are both painting and sculpture–or, some purists would say, neither."" Perreault praised the works for being memorable, photogenic, and able to ""stick in the mind"" as well as ""surprise and keep on surprising."" 
Rauschenberg went as far as to incorporate taxidermied animals, including birds, onto some of his Combines. For example, his 1955 work Satellite features a stuffed pheasant ""patrolling its top edge."" Additionally, his work Canyon (1959) includes a golden eagle affixed to its front. In another work, Odalisk (1955/1958), Rauschenberg included a stuffed rooster.
His Combine Broadcast, which features three concealed radios behind the painting, was called a ""melange of paint, grids, newspaper clips and fabric snippets"" by Grace Glueck of the New York Times. 
The prevailing theme of Rauschenberg's Combine paintings, according to Edmund Burke Feldman, is ""nonmeaning, the absurd, or antiart."" In this regard the Combine paintings relate to the succeeding Pop art and the much earlier predecessor: the Dada Movement of the early 1900s. Rauschenberg himself said ""I don't want a painting to be just an expression of my personality. I feel it ought to be much better than that … I’ve always felt as though, whatever I’ve used and whatever I’ve done, the method was always closer to a collaboration with materials than to any kind of conscious manipulation and control.""

Nunatak,"A nunatak (from Inuit nunataq) is the summit or ridge of a mountain that protrudes from an ice field or glacier that otherwise covers most of the mountain or ridge. They often form natural pyramidal peaks. Isolated nunataks are also called glacial islands, and smaller nunataks rounded by glacial action may be referred to as rognons.
The word is of Greenlandic origin and has been used in English since the 1870s.

Description
The term nunatak is typically used in areas where a permanent ice sheet is present and the ridge protrudes above the sheet. Nunataks present readily identifiable landmark reference points in glaciers or ice caps and are often named. While some are isolated, they can also form dense clusters, such as Queen Louise Land in Greenland.
Nunataks are generally angular and jagged, hampering the formation of glacial ice on their tops, although snow can accumulate on them. This can contrast strongly with the softer contours of the glacially eroded land after a glacier retreats. They are not greatly affected by frost weathering, given the low frequency of freeze-thaw cycles in areas of ice caps and ice sheets.
Typically nunataks are the only places where plant life can survive on ice sheets or ice caps. Lifeforms on nunataks are often isolated by the surrounding ice or glacier, providing unique habitats.

Cordillera,"A cordillera is a chain or network of mountain ranges, such as those in the west coast of the Americas. The term is borrowed from Spanish, where the word comes from cordilla, a diminutive of cuerda ('rope').
The term is most commonly used in physical geography and is particularly applied to the various large mountain systems of the American Cordillera, such as the Andes of South America, and less frequently to other mountain ranges in the ""ridge"" that rims the Pacific Ocean. In Colombia and Venezuela, cordilleras are named according to their position: Cordillera Occidental, Central, and Oriental. Various local names are used for the cordilleras in Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile and Argentina.
Such mountain systems have a complex structure, which is usually the result of folding and faulting accompanied by volcanic activity. In South America, the ranges include numerous volcanic peaks. The Andes cordillera has Ojos del Salado, the highest active volcano in the world and second-highest point in the Western Hemisphere (though not itself a volcano, Argentina's Aconcagua, at 6,960 m (22,830 ft), is the highest point in the Western Hemisphere). Some of the volcanoes have been active in historical times.
Aside from the volcanic peaks, the cordilleran crests include many narrow ridges, some of which reach into the zone of permanent snow. Between the ranges are numerous inhabited valleys, basins and low plateaus, with a wide range of elevations.

Geo-replication,"Geo-replication systems are designed to provide improved availability and disaster tolerance by using geographically distributed data centers. This is intended to improve the response time for applications such as web portals. Geo-replication can be achieved using software, hardware or a combination of the two.

Software
Geo-replication software is a network performance-enhancing technology that is designed to provide improved access to portal or intranet content for uses at the most remote parts of large organizations. It is based on the principle of storing complete replicas of portal content on local servers, and then keeping the content on those servers up-to-date using heavily compressed data updates.

Portal acceleration
Geo-replication technologies are used to provide replication of the content of portals, intranets, web applications, content and data between servers, across wide area networks WAN to allow users at remote sites to access central content at LAN speeds.
Geo-replication software can improve the performance of data networks that suffer limited bandwidth, latency and periodic disconnection. Terabytes of data can be replicated over a wide area network, giving remote sites faster access to web applications.
Geo-replication software uses a combination of data compression and content caching technologies. differencing technologies can also be employed to reduce the volume of data that has to be transmitted to keep portal content accurate across all servers. This update compression can reduce the load that portal traffic place on networks, and improve the response time of a portal.

Portal replication
Remote users of web portals and collaboration environments will frequently experience network bandwidth and latency problems which will slow down their experience of opening and closing files, and otherwise interacting with the portal. Geo-replication technology is deployed to accelerate the remote end user portal performance to be equivalent to that experienced by users locally accessing the portal in the central office.

Differencing engine technologies
To deliver this reduction in the size of the required data updates across a portal, geo-replication systems often use differencing engine technologies. These systems are able to difference the content of each portal server right down to the byte level. This knowledge of the content that is already on each server enables the system to rebuild any changes to the content on one server, across each of the other servers in the deployment from content already hosted on those other servers. This type of differencing system ensures that no content, at the byte level, is ever sent to a server twice.

Offline portal replication on laptops
Geo-replication systems are often extended to deliver local replication beyond the server and down to the laptop used by a single user. Server to laptop replication enables mobile users to have access to a local replica of their business portal on a standard laptop. This technology may be employed to provide in the field access to portal content by, for example, sales forces and combat forces.

Indian Ocean,"The Indian Ocean is the third-largest of the world's five oceanic divisions, covering 70,560,000 km2 (27,240,000 sq mi) or approximately 20% of the water area of Earth's surface. It is bounded by Asia to the north, Africa to the west and Australia to the east. To the south it is bounded by the Southern Ocean or Antarctica, depending on the definition in use. The Indian Ocean has large marginal or regional seas, including the Andaman Sea, the Arabian Sea, the Bay of Bengal, and the Laccadive Sea.
Geologically, the Indian Ocean is the youngest of the oceans, and it has distinct features such as narrow continental shelves. Its average depth is 3,741 m. It is the warmest ocean, with a significant impact on global climate due to its interaction with the atmosphere. Its waters are affected by the Indian Ocean Walker circulation, resulting in unique oceanic currents and upwelling patterns. The Indian Ocean is ecologically diverse, with important ecosystems such as coral reefs, mangroves, and sea grass beds. It hosts a significant portion of the world's tuna catch and is home to endangered marine species. The climate around the Indian Ocean is characterized by monsoons.
The Indian Ocean has been a hub of cultural and commercial exchange since ancient times. It played a key role in early human migrations and the spread of civilizations. In modern times, it remains crucial for global trade, especially in oil and hydrocarbons. Environmental and geopolitical concerns in the region include climate change, overfishing, pollution, piracy, and disputes over island territories.

Etymology
The Indian Ocean has been known by its present name since at least 1515, when the Latin form Oceanus Orientalis Indicus (lit. 'Indian Eastern Ocean') is attested, named after India, which projects into it. It was earlier known as the Eastern Ocean, a term that was still in use during the mid-18th century, as opposed to the Western Ocean (Atlantic) before the Pacific was surmised. In modern times, the name Afro-Asian Ocean has occasionally been used.
The Hindi name for the Ocean is हिंद महासागर (Hind Mahāsāgar; lit. transl. Ocean of India). Conversely, Chinese explorers (e.g., Zheng He during the Ming dynasty) who traveled to the Indian Ocean during the 15th century called it the Western Oceans. In Ancient Greek geography, the Indian Ocean region known to the Greeks was called the Erythraean Sea.

Geography
Extent and data
The borders of the Indian Ocean, as delineated by the International Hydrographic Organization in 1953, included the Southern Ocean but not the marginal seas along the northern rim. In 2002 the IHO delimited the Southern Ocean separately, which removed waters south of 60°S from the Indian Ocean but included the northern marginal seas. Meridionally, the Indian Ocean is delimited from the Atlantic Ocean by the 20° east meridian, running south from Cape Agulhas, South Africa, and from the Pacific Ocean by the meridian of 146°49'E, running south from South East Cape on the island of Tasmania in Australia. The northernmost extent of the Indian Ocean (including marginal seas) is approximately 30°N in the Persian Gulf.
The Indian Ocean covers 70,560,000 km2 (27,240,000 sq mi), including the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf but excluding the Southern Ocean, or 19.5% of the world's oceans. Its volume is 264,000,000 km3 (63,000,000 cu mi) or 19.8% of the world's oceans' volume; it has an average depth of 3,741 m (12,274 ft) and a maximum depth of 7,290 m (23,920 ft).
All of the Indian Ocean is in the Eastern Hemisphere. The centre of the Eastern Hemisphere, the 90th meridian east, passes through the Ninety East Ridge.
Within these waters are a number of islands. These include those controlled by surrounding countries, and independent island states and territories. Of the non-coastal islands, there are two broad clusters: one around Madagascar, and one south of India. A few other oceanic islands are scattered elsewhere.: 29–30

Coasts and shelves
In contrast to the Atlantic and Pacific, the Indian Ocean is enclosed by major landmasses and an archipelago on three sides and does not stretch from pole to pole, and can be likened to an embayed ocean. It is centered on the Indian Peninsula. Although this subcontinent has played a significant role in its history, the Indian Ocean has foremostly been a cosmopolitan stage, interlinking diverse regions by innovations, trade, and religion since early in human history.
The active margins of the Indian Ocean have an average width (horizontal distance from land to shelf break) of 19 ± 0.61 km (11.81 ± 0.38 mi) with a maximum width of 175 km (109 mi). The passive margins have an average width of 47.6 ± 0.8 km (29.58 ± 0.50 mi).
The average width of the slopes (horizontal distance from shelf break to foot of slope) of the continental shelves are 50.4–52.4 km (31.3–32.6 mi) for active and passive margins respectively, with a maximum width of 205.3–255.2 km (127.6–158.6 mi).

Mere (lake),"A mere is a shallow lake, pond, or wetland, particularly in Great Britain and other parts of western Europe.

Derivation of the word
Etymology
The word mere is recorded in Old English as mere ″sea, lake″, corresponding to

Old Saxon meri,
Old Low Franconian *meri (Dutch meer ″lake, pool″, Picard mer ″pool, lake″, Northern French toponymic element -mer),
Old High German mari / meri (German Meer ″sea″, but also Maar ″circular lake″),
Goth. mari-, marei,
Old Norse marr ″sea″ (Norwegian mar ″sea″, Shetland Norn mar ″mer, deep water fishing area″, Faroese marrur ″mud, sludge″, Swedish place name element mar-, French mare ″pool, pond″).
They derive from reconstituted Proto-Germanic *mari, itself from Indo-European *mori, the same root as marsh and moor. The Indo-European root *mori gave also birth to similar words in other European languages: Latin mare, ″sea″ (Italian mare, Spanish mar, French mer); Old Celtic *mori, ″sea″ (Gaulish mori-, more, Irish muir, Welsh môr, Breton mor); and Old Slavic morje.

Signification
The word once included the sea or an arm of the sea in its range of meaning but this marine usage is now obsolete (OED). It is a poetical or dialect word meaning a sheet of standing water, a lake or a pond (OED). The OED's fourth definition (""A marsh, a fen."") includes wetland such as fen amongst usages of the word which is reflected in the lexicographers' recording of it. In a quotation from the year 598, mere is contrasted against moss (bog) and field against fen. The OED quotation from 1609 does not say what a mere is, except that it looks black. In 1629 mere and marsh were becoming interchangeable but in 1876 mere was ""heard, at times, applied to ground permanently under water"": in other words, a very shallow lake.
The online edition of the OED's quoted examples relate to:

the sea: Old English to 1530: 7 quotations
standing water: Old English to 1998: 22 quotations
arm of the sea: 1573 to 1676: 4 quotations
marsh or fen: 1609 to 1995: 7 quotations

Characteristics
Where land similar to that of Martin Mere, gently undulating glacial till, becomes flooded and develops fen and bog, the remnants of the original mere remain until the whole is filled with peat. This can be delayed where the mere is fed by lime-rich water from chalk or limestone upland and a significant proportion of the outflow from the mere takes the form of evaporation. In these circumstances, the lime (typically calcium carbonate) is deposited on the peaty bed and inhibits plant growth, therefore, peat formation. A typical feature of these meres is that they are alongside a river rather than having the river flowing through them. In this way, the mere is replenished by seepage from the bed of the lime-rich river, through the river's natural levée, or by winter floods. The water of the mere is then static through the summer, when the concentration of the calcium carbonate rises until it is precipitated on the bed of the mere.
Even quite shallow lake water can develop a thermocline in the short term but where there is a moderately windy climate, the circulation caused by wind drift is sufficient to break this up. (The surface is blown down-wind in a seiche and a return current passes either near the bottom or just above the thermocline if that is present at a sufficient depth.) This means that the bed of the shallow mere is aerated and bottom-feeding fish and wildfowl can survive, providing a livelihood for people around. Expressed more technically, the mere consists entirely of the epilimnion. This is quite unlike Windermere where in summer, there is a sharp thermocline at a depth of 9 to 15 metres, well above the maximum depth of 60 metres or so. (M&W p36)
At first sight, the defining feature of a mere is its breadth in relation to its shallow depth. This means that it has a large surface in proportion to the volume of water it contains. However, there is a limiting depth beyond which a lake does not behave as a mere since the sun does not warm the deeper water and the wind does not mix it. Here, a thermocline develops but where the limiting dimensions lie is influenced by the sunniness and windiness of the site and the murkiness of the water. This last usually depends on how eutrophic (rich in plant nutrients) the water is. Nonetheless, in general, with the enlargement of the extent of a mere, the depth has to become proportionately less if it is to behave as a mere.

List of paleocontinents,"This is a list of paleocontinents, significant landmasses that have been proposed to exist in the geological past. The degree of certainty to which the identified landmasses can be regarded as independent entities reduces as geologists look further back in time. The list includes cratons, supercratons, microcontinents, continents and supercontinents. For the Archean to Paleoproterozoic cores of most of the continents see also list of shields and cratons.

Geographic contiguity,"Geographic contiguity is the characteristic in geography of political or geographical land divisions, as a group, not being interrupted by other land or water. Such divisions are referred to as being contiguous.  In the United States, for example, the ""48 contiguous states"" excludes Hawaii and Alaska, which do not share borders with other U.S. states.
Other examples of geographical contiguity might include the ""contiguous European Union"" excluding member states such as Ireland, Sweden, Finland (between Åland and Turku Archipelago), Malta and Cyprus (these being non-contiguous), or the ""contiguous United Kingdom"" referring to all parts of the country excepting Northern Ireland (it being geographically non-contiguous).
Two or more contiguous municipalities can be consolidated into one, or one municipality can consist of many noncontiguous elements. For example, the Financially Distressed Municipalities Act allows the commonwealth of Pennsylvania to merge contiguous municipalities to reduce financial distress.
Geographic contiguity is important in biology, especially animal ranges. For a particular species, its habitat may be a 'contiguous range', or it might be broken, requiring periodic, typically seasonal migrations (see: Disjunct distribution). The same concept of contiguous range is true for human transportation studies in an attempt to understand census geography. It also comes into play with electoral geography and politics.
In United States real property and mineral rights law, touching of two tracts at a common corner (as checkerboarded land) is generally considered contiguous.

Figure painting,"A figure painting is a work of fine art in any of the painting media with the primary subject being the human figure, whether clothed or nude. Figure painting may also refer to the activity of creating such a work. The human figure has been one of the constant subjects of art since the first Stone Age cave paintings, and has been reinterpreted in various styles throughout history.
Unlike figure drawings which are usually nudes, figure paintings are often clothed depictions which may be either historically accurate or symbolic. 
Figure painting is not synonymous with figurative art, which may depict real objects of any kind (including humans and animals).

Clothed figures
Portraiture
A portrait painting focuses on the creation of a likeness of a particular individual or group.

Everyday life
Genre painting portray ordinary people engaged in common activities.

Narrative paintings
Historical paintings depict events in a narrative, which may be allegorical.

Nude figures
The nude has been a theme in Western art since classical antiquity and again in Renaissance art, after being largely absent during the Middle Ages.
While standing nude figures of both sexes are found in antiquity, in Western art, male nudes were more prevalent through the idealisation of the male form in society. The first female reclining nudes as a popular genre appeared during the Renaissance, most notably in a work by Giorgione. Oil paint historically has been the ideal media for depicting the figure. By blending and layering paint, the surface can become more like skin. ""Its slow drying time and various degrees of viscosity enable the artist to achieve rich and subtle blends of color and texture, which can suggest transformations from one human substance to another."" Although working from live models is preferred, the length of time needed to complete a painting has led most modern painters to use photographs as references at least part of the time if not for the entire work.

Geocriticism,"Geocriticism is a method of literary analysis and literary theory that incorporates the study of geographic space. The term designates a number of different critical practices.  In France, Bertrand Westphal has elaborated the concept of géocritique in several works.  In the United States, Robert Tally has argued for a geocriticism as a critical practice suited to the analysis of what he has termed ""literary cartography"".

Origins
Some of the first expressly geocritical writings emerged from symposia organized by  Westphal at the University of Limoges. Westphal's foundational essay, ""Pour une approche géocritique des textes"" constitutes a manifesto for geocriticism.  Westphal's theory is elaborated in greater detail in his Geocriticism: Real and Fictional Spaces, translated by Tally, who also provides a brief introduction.  But there are also many works addressing similar themes and using similar methods that might be considered geocritical, even if the term ""geocriticism"" is not used.

Theory
In Westphal's theory, geocriticism is based on three theoretical concepts: spatio-temporality, transgressivity, and referentiality. 
The idea that space and time form a continuum (space-time) is a tenet of modern physics. In the field of literary theory, geocriticism is an interdisciplinary method of literary analysis that focuses not only on such temporal data as relations between the life and times of the author (as in biographical criticism), the history of the text (as in textual criticism), or the story (as studied by narratology), but also on spatial data. Geocriticism therefore has affinities with geography, architecture, urban studies, and so on; it also correlates to philosophical concepts such as deterritorialization.
Following the work of Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze, Henri Lefebvre and Mikhail Bakhtin, among others, a geocritical approach to literature recognizes that representations of space are often transgressive, crossing the boundaries of established norms while also reestablishing new relations among people, places, and things. Cartography is no longer seen as the exclusive province of the state or the government; rather, various agents or groups may be responsible for representing the geographic spaces at the same time and with different effects. In practice, therefore, geocriticism is multifocal, examining a variety of topics at once, thus differentiating itself from practices that focus on the singular point of view of the traveller or protagonist. 
Geocriticism also assumes a literary referentiality between world and text, or, in other words, between the referent and its representation. By questioning the relations between a given space's nature and its actually existing condition, the geocritical approach allows for a study of fiction that points also to the theory of possible worlds, such as may be seen in the work on third space by the American geographer Edward Soja (Thirdspace). Tally's book Spatiality, an introduction to spatiality studies in literature and critical theory, includes a chapter on geocriticism.

Critical practices
Geocriticism frequently involves the study of places described in the literature by various authors, but it can also study the effects of literary representations of a given space. An example of the range of geocritical practices can be found in Tally's collection Geocritical Explorations: Space, Place, and Mapping in Literary and Cultural Studies.
Geocriticism derives some of its practices from precursors whose theoretical work helped establish space as a valid topic for literary analysis.  For example, in The Poetics of Space and elsewhere, Gaston Bachelard studied literary works to develop a typology of places according to their connotations. Maurice Blanchot's writings have legitimized the idea of literary space, an imaginary place for the creation of the work of literature. One might also look at the developments of cultural studies and especially postcolonial studies, such as Raymond Williams's The Country and the City or Edward Said's Culture and Imperialism, which employ what Said has called a ""geographical inquiry into historical experience.""  Fredric Jameson's concept of cognitive mapping and his theoretical engagement with the postmodern condition also highlight the importance of spatial representation and aesthetic productions, including literature, film, architecture, and design.  In The Atlas of European Novel, 1800-1900, Franco Moretti has examined the diffusion of literary spaces in Europe, focusing on the complex relationship between the text and space. Moretti has also promulgated a theory of literary history, or literary geography, that would use maps to bring to light new connections between the texts studied and their social spaces.  And, in his study of Herman Melville's literary cartography, Robert Tally has offered a geocritical approach to certain texts.

Megalopolis,"A megalopolis () or a supercity, also called a megaregion, is a group of metropolitan areas which are perceived as a continuous urban area through common systems of transport, economy, resources, ecology, and so on. They are integrated enough that coordinating policy is valuable, although the constituent metropolises keep their individual identities. The megalopolis concept has become highly influential as it introduced a new, larger scale thinking about urban patterns and growth.

Etymology and earlier definitions
The term comes from the Greek word megalo-polis (big city), and has specific geographic definitions dating from 1832, when its meaning was ""a very large, heavily populated urban complex"".
In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Jean Gottmann, a professor of political science at the University of Paris and member of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, directed ""A Study of Megalopolis"" for The Twentieth Century Fund, wherein he described a megalopolis as a ""world of ideas"". Gottmann, in his extensive studies, applied the term megalopolis to an analysis of the urbanized northeastern seaboard of the U.S., in particular from Boston, Massachusetts to Washington, D.C. (the Northeast megalopolis).

Modern definitions
A megalopolis may also be called a megaregion. ""Megalopolis"" and other similar terms have been used by different scholars and countries to describe similar spatial forms.

A megalopolis, following the work of Gottmann, refers to two or more roughly adjacent metropolitan areas that, through a commonality of systems—e.g., of transport, economy, resources, and ecologies—experience a blurring of the boundaries between the population centers, such that while some degree of separation may remain, their perception as a continuous urban area is of value, e.g., ""to coordinate policy at this expanded scale"". Simply put, a megalopolis (or a megaregion) is a clustered network of big cities. Gottmann defined its population as 25 million, while Doxiadis defined a small megalopolis a similar cluster with a population of about 10 million. America 2050, a program of the Regional Plan Association (RPA), lists 11 megaregions in the United States and Canada.
Megaregions of the United States were explored in a July 2005 report by Robert E. Lang and Dawn Dhavale of the Metropolitan Institute at Virginia Tech. A later 2007 article by Lang and Nelson uses 20 ""megapolitan"" areas grouped into 10 megaregions. The concept is based on the original ""Megalopolis model"".
Modern interlinked ground transportation corridors, such as rail and highway, often aid in the development of megalopolises. Using these commuter passageways to travel throughout the megalopolis is informally called megaloping, a term coined by Davide Gadren and Stefan Berteau.
In Brazil, the term megarregião has a legal meaning, different from the English word megaregion: mesoregions of Brazil (mesorregião) and microregions of Brazil (microrregião).
In China, the official term corresponding to the meaning of ""megalopolis"" is '城市群' (chéngshì qún), which, in Chinese, was originally coined by Yao Shimou and literally means ""city cluster"". A ""city cluster"" is defined as ""[a]n area in which cities are relatively densely distributed in a certain region"". In an older standard, the term was mistranslated as ""agglomeration"". In 2019, National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC)  published guidelines and made a distinction from a similar concept ""metropolitan area"" (都市圈), which is of a smaller scale than a city cluster. In the latest standard terminologies of both economics and urban planning, 城市群 is translated as ""city cluster"", replacing ""agglomeration"". Megalopolises in China have become the subject of national government planning.
Since, presently, urban data are based on arbitrary definitions that vary from country to country and from year or census to the next, making them difficult to compare, an Urban Metric System (UMS) has been conceived that could correct the problem, since it allows computing the urban area limits and central points, and it can be applied in the same way to all past, present and future population and job distributions. 
UMS is based on vector field calculations obtained by assuming that, in a given space, all inhabitants and jobs exert the same attractive force A and repulsive force R. The net force (A - R) exerted by each inhabitant or job is given by [1/(1 + d)] - [1/( β + d/2)], where d = distance and β is the only parameter. 
UMS distinguishes the following types of urban areas (including ""Megalopolis""), each type corresponding to a given value of β:

UMS has been applied to some Canadian cases since 2018, but the data presented in this article are still based on the various existing national definitions, which are disparate.

Paleocontinent,"A paleocontinent or palaeocontinent is a distinct area of continental crust that existed as a major landmass in the geological past. There have been many different landmasses throughout Earth's time. They range in sizes; some are just a collection of small microcontinents while others are large conglomerates of crust. As time progresses and sea levels rise and fall more crust can be exposed making way for larger landmasses. The continents of the past shaped the evolution of organisms on Earth and contributed to the climate of the globe as well. As landmasses break apart, species are separated and those that were once the same now have evolved to their new climate. The constant movement of these landmasses greatly determines the distribution of organisms on Earth's surface. This is evident with how similar fossils are found on completely separate continents. Also, as continents move, mountain building events (orogenies) occur, causing a shift in the global climate as new rock is exposed and then there is more exposed rock at higher elevations. This causes glacial ice expansion and an overall cooler global climate. The movement of the continents greatly affects the overall dispersal of organisms throughout the world and the trend in climate throughout Earth's history. Examples include Laurentia, Baltica and Avalonia, which collided together during the Caledonian orogeny to form the Old Red Sandstone paleocontinent of Laurussia. Another example includes a collision that occurred during the late Pennsylvanian and early Permian time when there was a collision between the two continents of Tarimsky and Kirghiz-Kazakh. This collision was caused because of their askew convergence when the paleoceanic basin closed.

Examples
The examples below are condensed in order to portray a brief overview of several paleocontinents.

Gondwana
Location
Gondwana was located in the southern hemisphere, with the land mass that makes up current day Antarctica closest to the South Pole. The continent reaches from just above the equator to the South Pole. Current day South America and Africa are closest to the equator with Northern Africa intersecting the equator.

Time period
600-180 mya, Precambrian - Jurassic Period.

Formation
Gondwana was made of present-day South America, Africa, Arabia, India, Antarctica, Australia, and Madagascar. The Continent was fully formed by the late Precambrian period. This was 600 million years ago. It was an amalgamation of all the current southern hemisphere continents. Gondwana lasted through many different time periods and was a part of other super continents, like Pangea.

Demise
Gondwana broke up in distinct stages. The continent started to split during the Jurassic Period around 180 million years ago. The first event was the separation of the western half of Gondwana, which includes Africa and South America, from the eastern half, which includes Antarctica, Australia, Madagascar, and India. Next, 40 million years later, South America and Africa began to split which began to open up the Atlantic Ocean. Also around this time India and Madagascar began to detach from Australia and Antarctica. This separation created the Indian Ocean. Lastly, in the Cretaceous, India and Madagascar began to split and Australia and Antarctica began to detach from one another.

Life
The life on Gondwana has changed throughout its existence. Gondwana was a smaller piece of Rodinia and stayed together all the way through the breakup of Pangea. This allowed Gondwana to host almost all species that have ever lived on Earth. Gondwana also was a part of some great mass extinction events. During the Ordovician, sea levels rose so much that the entire Gondwana continent was covered, at this time marine life was dominant. Also, vertebrates started to make an appearance in the fossil record. Terrestrial species started to become more prominent in the Silurian, however, in the Devonian modern fish and shark species began to diversify, and terrestrial vegetation begun colonizing the continent, as organic soil accumulation can be detected. Amniotic eggs started to evolve as more terrestrial land became available with rising land masses and lowering sea levels. During the Permian extinction, almost all marine species were lost, along with some terrestrial species. This event gave rise to terrestrial species, such as reptiles, dinosaurs, and small mammals.

Climate
Gondwana experienced a variety of climates as it has been a land mass from 600 million years ago in the Precambrian to the Early Jurassic with the breakup of Pangea. In the Cambrian, there was a warmer and milder climate because most continental crust was closer to the equator and not the poles. The continent endured an ice age during the Ordovician period and deglaciation was still occurring during the Silurian period. The climate started to become more humid and tropical throughout the globe and there was a lack of seasonality.

Bittern (salt),"Bittern (pl. bitterns), or nigari, is the salt solution formed when halite (table salt) precipitates from seawater or brines. Bitterns contain magnesium, calcium, and potassium ions as well as chloride, sulfate, iodide, and other ions.
Bittern is commonly formed in salt ponds where the evaporation of water prompts the precipitation of halite. These salt ponds can be part of a salt-producing industrial facility, or they can be used as a waste storage location for brines produced in desalination processes.
Bittern is a source of many useful salts. It is used as a natural source of Mg2+, and it can be used as a coagulant both in the production of tofu and in the treatment of industrial wastewater.

History
Bittern has been extracted for a long time, at least several centuries. The Dutch chemist Petrus Jacobus Kipp (1808–1864) experimented with saturated solutions of bittern. The term for the solution is a modification of ""bitter"".

Uses
Salt derivation
Bittern is a source of many salts including magnesium sulfate (epsom salt). Multiple methods exist for removing these salts from the bittern, and the method ultimately used depends on the target product. Products that would naturally precipitate from the bitterns crystallize as evaporation proceeds (e. g. kainite). Products that do not preferentially precipitate from bitterns may precipitate through the addition of another compound or through ion exchange.
Potassium-magnesium sulfate double salt, a good fertilizer, is a salt that precipitates from bitterns upon addition of methanol. Ethanol is also used, but it exhibits a preference for potassium sulfate precipitation.
The solution can furthermore be used in the production of potash and potassium salts. Tartaric acid is one compound that can facilitate the precipitation of these salts.
Magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)2) can be derived from bittern. Adding an alkaline solution such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or lime will cause magnesium hydroxide to precipitate, although lime is not as effective. Slower addition of the alkaline solution results in the precipitation of larger particles that are easier to remove from solution.

Coagulation
Tofu
Nigari is produced from seawater after first removing sodium chloride. It contains mostly magnesium chloride, smaller amounts of magnesium sulfate (Epsom salt), potassium chloride, calcium chloride, and trace amounts of other naturally occurring salts. 
Nigari was the first coagulant used to make tofu in Japan. It is still used today because tofu made using bittern preserves the original flavor of the soybeans used to make it. Bittern causes rapid coagulation which influences the quality of the tofu. Alternatively calcium sulfate, calcium chloride or other substances are also used.

Wastewater treatment
Bittern can be used instead of aluminum-based coagulants in the treatment of wastewater produced during the fabric-dyeing process. The wastewater pH is basic, which is favorable for the use of bittern. After the addition of bittern, precipitated magnesium hydroxide works as the coagulant to collect dye, solids, organic matter, and heavy metals from the wastewater before settling out of solution. The sludge produced from this wastewater treatment is also easier to dispose of than sludge produced by aluminum-based coagulants because there are less restrictions surrounding the disposal of magnesium, and it may be possible to recycle the sludge as fertilizer.
Bittern can also be used as a source of magnesium ions (Mg2+) for the precipitation of struvite, a useful fertilizer, from wastewater containing nitrogen and phosphorus. One source of useful wastewater is landfill leachate. Bittern is just as good as other sources of magnesium ions at removing phosphorus from wastewater streams, but it lags behind other magnesium ion sources in terms of the removal of ammonia (a nitrogen compound).

Other uses
Bittern can be used to culture Haloquadratum archaea. Haloquadratum are distinctly square-shaped and are abundant in hypersaline environments such as salt ponds. Their cultivation is necessary for understanding both their ecological function in those environments as well as their unique morphology. The presence of Haloquadratum in an environment deemed inhospitable for most life has prompted closer study of these archaea.
A study has been performed exploring the use of bittern as a natural magnesium supplement used to decrease cholesterol spikes after a meal (postprandial hyperlipidemia).
Due to its high salinity, bittern can also be used as a draw solution for an osmotic process that concentrates sucrose in sugarcane juice. Because forward osmosis is being used, the process is relatively energy-efficient. Epsom salt can also be taken from the bittern draw solution once it is used. This method is particularly useful in areas where sugarcane and salt production are in close proximity to avoid costs associated with movement of either the sugarcane juice or the bittern.

Blue space,"In urban planning and design, blue space (or blue infrastructure) comprises areas dominated by surface waterbodies or watercourses. In conjunction with greenspace (parks, gardens, etc. specifically: urban open space), it may help in reducing the risks of heat-related illness from high urban temperatures (urban heat island).
Substantial urban waterbodies naturally exist as integral features of the geography of many cities because of their historical development, for example the River Thames in London.
Accessible blue spaces can help revitalizing neighborhoods and promote increased social connectedness as seen on waterfront renovation projects like the Chattanooga Waterfront (Chattanooga, Tennessee),  the CityDeck in Green Bay, Wisconsin, or the Brooklyn Bridge Park in New York City, further enhanced by waterfront festivals such as the Christmas lights in Medellin, in Colombia. Design guidelines promoting healthy buildings -such as, WELL -managed by The International WELL Building Institute™ (IWBI™), or Fitwel -developed and managed by The Center for Active Design (CfAD), recommend incorporating  including and water features as a strategy to improve the health and wellness of the building occupants, and ""the 9 foundations of a Healthy Building"" -developed at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health-, also recommends indoor access to nature views or nature-inspired elements.
Because neighborhoods with access to attractive natural features are susceptible to gentrification, the social benefits associated with waterbodies can be unequally distributed, with less affluent areas lacking access to good quality blue spaces.

Health benefits
Proximity to water bodies may bring some risks to humans, like water-borne diseases in drinking water, flooding risks, or drowning. But scientific evidence shows that exposure to blue spaces is also associated with a variety of health benefits to those near water bodies.
This is described by marine biologist Wallace J. Nichols in his book Blue Mind. Another of the mechanisms by which this phenomenon can be explained is by the Biophilia hypothesis developed by Edward O. Wilson. This theory states that humans have developed a strong connection with nature throughout their evolution that leads to subconscious seeking for natural environments, including green and blue spaces.
Recent research has identified three main pathways that can further explain why proximity to green and blue spaces can be beneficial to health.

Mitigation addresses these health benefits in relationship to the physical improvements that natural environments bring to the built environment, such as reduction of urban heat island, traffic air pollution or traffic noise.
Instoration focuses on the promotion of physical activity and other positive outcomes associated with increased physical activity and social connectivity promoted by natural spaces.
Restoration explains how the non-threatening characteristics of the natural environments may reduce negative feelings and increase cognitive restoration.
Assessing the environmental benefits of a blue space intervention can be done by conducting a Health impact assessment (HIA).

Effects on physical health
Increased physical activity
A variety of studies have found that people living near coastal areas, are less sedentary  more likely to engage in moderate and vigorous physical activity adequate for health,  which could be explained due to the encouraging presence of walk paths along the coast. Another possible explanation is found in the aesthetical attributes of blue spaces that may motivate individuals to engage in physical activities on blue spaces. A study in England found that although more intense activities were conducted on visits to countryside and urban green spaces compared to visits to coastal environments, coastal visits were associated with the highest overall energy expenditure due duration of activity in coastal environments being longer. Results differed by the urbanity or rurality of the respondent's residence and also how far respondents travelled to their destination.
Proximity to water bodies alone is not enough to promote increased levels of physical activity, as those bodies need to be accessible to people. A study focusing on teenagers found that those living near beaches that had a major road between their homes and the water body had lower levels of physical activity than those with a direct access to the beach.

Reduced obesity
Visiting blue spaces may reduce obesity as it promotes increased physical activity. One study has suggested that living far from usable green space or waterfront in urban areas may increase the risk of obesity.

Improved respiratory health
Living near blue spaces can improve the quality of life of people with respiratory diseases, such as asthma, which could be explained by the mists and sprays generated by the water movement as shown on a study measuring the impact in health of green and blue spaces for those with chr",Lakes,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_space,1,urban planning design blue space blue infrastructure comprises area dominated surface waterbodies watercourse conjunction greenspace park garden etc specifically urban open space may help reducing risk heatrelated illness high urban temperature urban heat island substantial urban waterbodies naturally exist integral feature geography many city historical development example river thames london accessible blue space help revitalizing neighborhood promote increased social connectedness seen waterfront renovation project like chattanooga waterfront chattanooga tennessee citydeck green bay wisconsin brooklyn bridge park new york city enhanced waterfront festival christmas light medellin colombia design guideline promoting healthy building well managed international well building institute™ iwbi™ fitwel developed managed center active design cfad recommend incorporating including water feature strategy improve health wellness building occupant foundation healthy building developed harvard th chan school public health also recommends indoor access nature view natureinspired element neighborhood access attractive natural feature susceptible gentrification social benefit associated waterbodies unequally distributed less affluent area lacking access good quality blue space health benefit proximity water body may bring risk human like waterborne disease drinking water flooding risk drowning scientific evidence show exposure blue space also associated variety health benefit near water body described marine biologist wallace j nichols book blue mind another mechanism phenomenon explained biophilia hypothesis developed edward wilson theory state human developed strong connection nature throughout evolution lead subconscious seeking natural environment including green blue space recent research identified three main pathway explain proximity green blue space beneficial health mitigation address health benefit relationship physical improvement natural environment bring built environment reduction urban heat island traffic air pollution traffic noise instoration focus promotion physical activity positive outcome associated increased physical activity social connectivity promoted natural space restoration explains nonthreatening characteristic natural environment may reduce negative feeling increase cognitive restoration assessing environmental benefit blue space intervention done conducting health impact assessment hia effect physical health increased physical activity variety study found people living near coastal area less sedentary likely engage moderate vigorous physical activity adequate health could explained due encouraging presence walk path along coast another possible explanation found aesthetical attribute blue space may motivate individual engage physical activity blue space study england found although intense activity conducted visit countryside urban green space compared visit coastal environment coastal visit associated highest overall energy expenditure due duration activity coastal environment longer result differed urbanity rurality respondent residence also far respondent travelled destination proximity water body alone enough promote increased level physical activity body need accessible people study focusing teenager found living near beach major road home water body lower level physical activity direct access beach reduced obesity visiting blue space may reduce obesity promotes increased physical activity one study suggested living far usable green space waterfront urban area may increase risk obesity improved respiratory health living near blue space improve quality life people respiratory disease asthma could explained mist spray generated water movement shown study measuring impact health green blue space chr
Limnic eruption,"A limnic eruption, also known as a lake overturn, is a very rare type of natural hazard in which dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) suddenly erupts from deep lake waters, forming a gas cloud capable of asphyxiating wildlife, livestock, and humans. Scientists believe earthquakes, volcanic activity, and other explosive events can serve as triggers for limnic eruptions as the rising CO2 ejects water from the lake. Lakes in which such activity occurs are referred to as limnically active lakes or exploding lakes. Some features of limnically active lakes include:

CO2-saturated incoming water
A cool lake bottom indicating an absence of direct volcanic heat with lake waters
An upper and lower thermal layer with differing CO2 saturations
Proximity to areas with volcanic activity
Investigations of the Lake Monoun and Lake Nyos casualties led scientists to classify limnic eruptions as a distinct type of hazard event, even though they can be indirectly linked to volcanic eruptions.

Historical occurrences
Due to the largely invisible nature of the underlying cause (CO2 gas) behind limnic eruptions, it is difficult to determine to what extent, and when, eruptions have occurred in the past. The Roman historian Plutarch reports that in 406 BC, Lake Albano surged over the surrounding hills, despite there being no rain nor tributaries flowing into the lake to account for the rise in water level. The ensuing flood destroyed fields and vineyards before eventually pouring into the sea. This event is thought to have been caused by volcanic gases, trapped in sediment at the bottom of the lake and gradually building up until suddenly releasing, causing the water to overflow.
In recent history, this phenomenon has been observed twice. The first recorded limnic eruption occurred in Cameroon at Lake Monoun in 1984, causing asphyxiation and death of 37 people living nearby. A second, deadlier eruption happened at neighboring Lake Nyos in 1986, releasing over 80 million m3 of CO2, killing around 1,700 people and 3,000 livestock, again by asphyxiation.

A third lake, the much larger Lake Kivu, rests on the border between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda, and contains massive amounts of dissolved CO2. Sediment samples taken from the lake showed an event caused living creatures in the lake to go extinct around every 1,000 years, and caused nearby vegetation to be swept back into the lake. Limnic eruptions can be detected and quantified on a CO2 concentration scale by taking air samples of the affected region.The Messel pit fossil deposits of Messel, Germany, show evidence of a limnic eruption there in the early Eocene. Among the victims are perfectly preserved insects, frogs, turtles, crocodiles, birds, anteaters, insectivores, early primates, and paleotheres.

Causes
For a lake to undergo a limnic eruption, the water must be nearly saturated with gas. CO2 was the primary component in the two observed cases, Lake Nyos and Lake Monoun. In Lake Kivu's case, scientists, including lake physicist Alfred Johny Wüest, were also concerned about the concentrations of methane. CO2 may originate from volcanic gas emitted from under the lake, or from decomposition of organic material.
Before a lake becomes saturated, it behaves like an unopened carbonated  soft drink: the CO2 is dissolved in the water. In both lakes and soft drinks, CO2 dissolves much more readily at higher pressure due to Henry's law. When the pressure is released, the CO2 comes out of solution as bubbles of gas, which rise to the surface. CO2 also dissolves more readily in cooler water, so very deep lakes can dissolve very large amounts of CO2 since pressure increases, and temperature decreases, with depth. A small increase in water temperature can lead to the release of a large amount of CO2.
Once a lake is saturated, it is very unstable and it gives off a smell of rotten eggs and gunpowder, but a trigger is needed to set off an eruption. In the case of the 1986 Lake Nyos eruption, landslides were the suspected triggers, but a volcanic eruption, an earthquake, or even wind and rain storms can be potential triggers. Limnic eruptions can also be caused by gradual gas saturation at specific depths triggering spontaneous gas development. Regardless of cause, the trigger pushes gas-saturated water higher in the lake, where the reduced pressure is insufficient to keep gas in solution. The buoyancy from the resulting bubbles lifts the water even higher, releasing yet more bubbles. This process forms a column of gas, at which point the water at the bottom is pulled up by suction, and it too loses CO2 in a runaway process. This eruption discharges the gas into the air and can displace enough water to form a tsunami.
Limnic eruptions are exceptionally rare for several reasons. First, a CO2 source must exist; regions with volcanic activity are most at risk. Second, the vast majority of lakes are holomictic (their layers mix regularly), preventing a buildup of dissolved gases.

Ocean temperature,"The ocean temperature plays a crucial role in the global climate system, ocean currents and for marine habitats. It varies depending on depth, geographical location and season. Not only does the temperature differ in seawater, so does the salinity. Warm surface water is generally saltier than the cooler deep or polar waters. In polar regions, the upper layers of ocean water are cold and fresh.  Deep ocean water is cold, salty water found deep below the surface of Earth's oceans. This water has a uniform temperature of around 0-3 °C. The ocean temperature also depends on the amount of solar radiation falling on its surface. In the tropics, with the Sun nearly overhead, the temperature of the surface layers can rise to over 30 °C (86 °F). Near the poles the temperature in equilibrium with the sea ice is about −2 °C (28 °F). 
There is a continuous large-scale circulation of water in the oceans. One part of it is the thermohaline circulation (THC). It is driven by global density gradients created by surface heat and freshwater fluxes. Warm surface currents cool as they move away from the tropics. This happens as the water becomes denser and sinks. Changes in temperature and density move the cold water back towards the equator as a deep sea current. Then it eventually wells up again towards the surface.
Ocean temperature as a term applies to the temperature in the ocean at any depth. It can also apply specifically to the ocean temperatures that are not near the surface. In this case it is synonymous with deep ocean temperature).
It is clear that the oceans are warming as a result of climate change and this rate of warming is increasing.: 9  The upper ocean (above 700 m) is warming fastest, but the warming trend extends throughout the ocean. In 2022, the global ocean was the hottest ever recorded by humans.

Definition and types
Sea surface temperature
Deep ocean temperature
Experts refer to the temperature further below the surface as ocean temperature or deep ocean temperature. Ocean temperatures more than 20 metres below the surface vary by region and time. They contribute to variations in ocean heat content and ocean stratification. The increase of both ocean surface temperature and deeper ocean temperature is an important effect of climate change on oceans.
Deep ocean water is the name for cold, salty water found deep below the surface of Earth's oceans. Deep ocean water makes up about 90% of the volume of the oceans. Deep ocean water has a very uniform temperature of around 0-3 °C. Its salinity is about 3.5% or 35 ppt (parts per thousand).

Relevance
Ocean temperature and dissolved oxygen concentrations have a big influence on many aspects of the ocean. These two key parameters affect the ocean's primary productivity, the oceanic carbon cycle, nutrient cycles, and marine ecosystems. They work in conjunction with salinity and density to control a range of processes. These include mixing versus stratification, ocean currents and the thermohaline circulation.

Ocean heat content
Experts calculate ocean heat content by using ocean temperatures at different depths.

Measurements
There are various ways to measure ocean temperature. Below the sea surface, it is important to refer to the specific depth of measurement as well as measuring the general temperature. The reason is there is a lot of variation with depths. This is especially the case during the day. At this time low wind speed and a lot of sunshine may lead to the formation of a warm layer at the ocean surface and big changes in temperature as you get deeper. Experts call these strong daytime vertical temperature gradients a diurnal thermocline.
The basic technique involves lowering a device to measure temperature and other parameters electronically. This device is called CTD which stands for conductivity, temperature, and depth. It continuously sends the data up to the ship via a conducting cable. This device is usually mounted on a frame that includes water sampling bottles. Since the 2010s autonomous vehicles such as gliders or mini-submersibles have been increasingly available. They carry the same CTD sensors, but operate independently of a research ship.
Scientists can deploy CTD systems from research ships on moorings gliders and even on seals. With research ships they receive data through the conducting cable. For the other methods they use telemetry.
There are other ways of measuring sea surface temperature. At this near-surface layer measurements are possible using thermometers or satellites with spectroscopy. Weather satellites have been available to determine this parameter since 1967. Scientists created the first global composites during 1970.
The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) is widely used to measure sea surface temperature from space.: 90 
There are various devices to measure ocean temperatures at different depths. These include the Nansen bottle, bathythermograph, CTD, or ocean acoustic tomography.

Geography of aging,"Geography of aging or gerontological geography is an emerging field of knowledge of human geography that analyzes the socio-spatial implications of aging of the population from the understanding of the relationships between the physical-social environment and the elderly, at different scales, micro (city, region, country), etc.
Since the 1970s in a number of developed countries such as the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden, France, Spain, Australia, New Zealand and Japan, there have been increasing studies focusing on the understanding of spatial patterns of aging population, as well as aspects related to residential changes and provision of health and social services. Among the geographers of aging is S. Harper, who identified the phenomenon of aging associated with the social construction of old age and the processes of residential mobility of this group to the urban periphery, mainly nursing homes and sheltered housing.
The contribution of geographers of aging, such as Graham D. Rowles, SM. Golant, S. Harper, G. Laws, are contributing to environmental gerontology by understanding the environmental aspects of gerontology in developed and developing countries. Also in Spain, some geographers, such as Gloria Fernández-Mayoralas, Fermina Rojo-Pérez and Vicente Rodríguez-Rodríguez, have made outstanding contributions to the study of residential strategies, access to health services, and, in general, quality of Life of the elderly, as well as the impacts of Northern European retirees on the Costa del Sol, Spain.
In Latin America and Spain, Diego Sánchez-González has shed light on the deepening of issues such as the physical-built and social environment and the quality of life of the elderly; the importance of the natural environment (therapeutic natural landscape) on active and healthy aging in the place; residential strategies for the maintenance of the elderly in the communities; the socio-environmental vulnerability of the elderly in the face of climate change; as well as issues related to the attachment to the place (identity and public space); elderly people with disabilities and social exclusion; leisure and tourism of elderly; and the planning of gerontological and geriatric services.

Avulsion (river),"In sedimentary geology and fluvial geomorphology, avulsion is the rapid abandonment of a river channel and the formation of a new river channel. Avulsions occur as a result of channel slopes that are much less steep than the slope that the river could travel if it took a new course.

Deltaic and net-depositional settings
Avulsions are common in river deltas, where sediment deposits as the river enters the ocean and channel gradients are typically very small. This process is also known as delta switching.
Deposition from the river results in the formation of an individual deltaic lobe that pushes out into the sea. An example of a deltaic lobe is the bird's-foot delta of the Mississippi River, pictured at right with its sediment plumes. As the deltaic lobe advances, the slope of the river channel becomes lower, as the river channel is longer but has the same change in elevation. As the slope of the river channel decreases, it becomes unstable for two reasons. First, water under the force of gravity will tend to flow in the most direct course downslope. If the river could breach its natural levees (i.e., during a flood), it would spill out onto a new course with a shorter route to the ocean, thereby obtaining a more stable steeper slope. Second, as its slope is reduced, the amount of shear stress on the bed will decrease, resulting in deposition of more sediment within the channel and thus raising of the channel bed relative to the floodplain. This will make it easier for the river to breach its levees and cut a new channel that enters the ocean at a steeper slope.
When this avulsion occurs, the new channel carries sediment out to the ocean, building a new deltaic lobe.  The abandoned delta eventually subsides.
This process is also related to the distributary network of river channels that can be observed within a river delta. When the channel does this, some of its flow can remain in the abandoned channel. When these channel switching events happen repeatedly over time, a mature delta will gain a distributary network.
Subsidence of the delta and/or sea-level rise can further cause backwater and deposition in the delta. This deposition fills the channels and leaves a geologic record of channel avulsion in sedimentary basins. On average, an avulsion will occur every time the bed of a river channel aggrades enough that the river channel is superelevated above the floodplain by one channel-depth. In this situation, enough hydraulic head is available that any breach of the natural levees will result in an avulsion.

Erosional avulsions
Rivers can also avulse due to the erosion of a new channel that creates a straighter path through the landscape. This can happen during large floods in situations in which the slope of the new channel is significantly greater than that of the old channel. Where the new channel's slope is about the same as the old channel's slope, a partial avulsion will occur in which both channels are occupied by flow. An example of an erosional avulsion is the 2006 avulsion of the Suncook River in New Hampshire, in which heavy rains caused flow levels to rise. The river level backed up behind an old mill dam, which produced a shallowly-sloping pool that overtopped a sand and gravel quarry, connected with a downstream section of channel, and cut a new shorter channel at 25–50 meters per hour. Sediment mobilised by this erosional avulsion produced a depositionally-forced meander cutoff further downstream by superelevating the bed around the meander bend to nearly the level of the floodplain.
Another example is the Cheslatta River, once a small tributary of the Nechako River in British Columbia. In the 1950s the Cheslatta River was made to be the spillway of the then new Nechako Reservoir. The discharge of the spills far exceeds the original flow of the Cheslatta River, which has resulted in major erosion in the upper Cheslatta valley, with the scoured sediment being deposited in the lower valley. Large reservoir spills caused the lower Cheslatta River to avulse in 1961 and again in 1972, carving a new route to the Nechako River and depositing a fan of sediment called the Cheslatta Fan in the Nechako River. After 1972 a cofferdam was built to restore the river to its original course.

Meander cutoffs
An example of a minor avulsion is known as a meander cutoff, when a pronounced meander (hook) in a river is breached by a flow that connects the two closest parts of the hook to form a new channel. This occurs when the ratio between the channel slope and the potential slope after an avulsion is less than about 1/5.

Occurrence
Avulsion typically occurs during large floods which carry the power necessary to rapidly change the landscape. Dam removal could also lead to avulsion.
Avulsions usually occur as a downstream to upstream process via head cutting erosion. If a bank of a current stream is breached a new trench will be cut into the existing floodplain. It either cuts through floodplain deposits or reo",Rivers,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avulsion_(river),1,sedimentary geology fluvial geomorphology avulsion rapid abandonment river channel formation new river channel avulsion occur result channel slope much less steep slope river could travel took new course deltaic netdepositional setting avulsion common river delta sediment deposit river enters ocean channel gradient typically small process also known delta switching deposition river result formation individual deltaic lobe push sea example deltaic lobe birdsfoot delta mississippi river pictured right sediment plume deltaic lobe advance slope river channel becomes lower river channel longer change elevation slope river channel decrease becomes unstable two reason first water force gravity tend flow direct course downslope river could breach natural levee ie flood would spill onto new course shorter route ocean thereby obtaining stable steeper slope second slope reduced amount shear stress bed decrease resulting deposition sediment within channel thus raising channel bed relative floodplain make easier river breach levee cut new channel enters ocean steeper slope avulsion occurs new channel carry sediment ocean building new deltaic lobe abandoned delta eventually subsides process also related distributary network river channel observed within river delta channel flow remain abandoned channel channel switching event happen repeatedly time mature delta gain distributary network subsidence delta andor sealevel rise cause backwater deposition delta deposition fill channel leaf geologic record channel avulsion sedimentary basin average avulsion occur every time bed river channel aggrades enough river channel superelevated floodplain one channeldepth situation enough hydraulic head available breach natural levee result avulsion erosional avulsion river also avulse due erosion new channel creates straighter path landscape happen large flood situation slope new channel significantly greater old channel new channel slope old channel slope partial avulsion occur channel occupied flow example erosional avulsion avulsion suncook river new hampshire heavy rain caused flow level rise river level backed behind old mill dam produced shallowlysloping pool overtopped sand gravel quarry connected downstream section channel cut new shorter channel – meter per hour sediment mobilised erosional avulsion produced depositionallyforced meander cutoff downstream superelevating bed around meander bend nearly level floodplain another example cheslatta river small tributary nechako river british columbia cheslatta river made spillway new nechako reservoir discharge spill far exceeds original flow cheslatta river resulted major erosion upper cheslatta valley scoured sediment deposited lower valley large reservoir spill caused lower cheslatta river avulse carving new route nechako river depositing fan sediment called cheslatta fan nechako river cofferdam built restore river original course meander cutoff example minor avulsion known meander cutoff pronounced meander hook river breached flow connects two closest part hook form new channel occurs ratio channel slope potential slope avulsion less occurrence avulsion typically occurs large flood carry power necessary rapidly change landscape dam removal could also lead avulsion avulsion usually occur downstream upstream process via head cutting erosion bank current stream breached new trench cut existing floodplain either cut floodplain deposit reo
Night School Studio,"Night School Studio, LLC is an American video game developer and publisher. It was founded on June 6, 2014 by Sean Krankel and Adam Hines, and it is based in Glendale, California.
After the founding of the company, the team started development on their debut, Oxenfree. After setting up a casting call on Backstage, the team moved to the development of the game. The first footage of the game was released on May 18, 2015, and the release was set for January 2016. Soon after, the game received positive reviews and a film adaptation is in plans with Skybound Entertainment.
Along with Telltale Games, Night School Studio also co-developed the ""Text Adventure"" mode for Mr. Robot:1.51exfiltrati0n (called Mr. Robot:1.51exfiltrati0n.ipa on iOS and Mr. Robot:1.51exfiltrati0n.apk on Android). Night School Studio was acquired by Netflix in September 2021 as part of the streaming service's venture into video games.

History
Night School Studio was founded on October 1, 2014 by Sean Krankel and his cousin Adam Hines, both respectively former Disney Interactive Studios and Telltale Games developers. After setting up the company, the team then decided to develop a new game. Soon after, a casting call was issued by the company on Backstage which then expired on November 21, 2014.

On March 1, 2015, the team posted a video titled ""OXENFREE Official Trailer #1"" onto their YouTube account. The group then announced Oxenfree on March 5, in which the plot revolved around a group of teenagers exploring a decommissioned island surrounded by ghosts. The studio, according to Krankel, had a very tight budget and could only make a single game. Gameplay footage was then released on 18 May. On October 23, the second teaser was released, as well as the game's release slated for January 2016. On October 27, in an interview with Koalition, when asked about the talking mechanic, Krankel said:If talking is the core mechanic of the game, how can we streamline the talking process? First, we can stop taking player control away and forcing the player into a cut scene. Next, we can put the dialogue choices as close to the player character as possible, so their dialogue choices really feel like an extension of their avatar. Those two design goals really drove a lot of our creative choices; everything from camera placement to the art direction to the pacing of the game.On January 14, 2016, the launch trailer was released. A day after, the game was released for Microsoft Windows, OS X and Xbox One. Within the same day, Skybound Entertainment announced a partnership with Night School Studio, in which a web series entitled The Story of Oxenfree was then released, detailing development on the game, as well a film adaptation and merchandise. On April 27 the company then announced that PlayStation 4 version would be released, with an extended mode called Game+, and was included in all versions after release. It was then released on 31 May, with a Linux version released on June 1. The game received positive reviews from critics, and was selected for Indiecade, which will be hosted from October 14–16 in San Francisco.
During August 2016, Mr. Robot:1.51exfiltrati0n, a mobile game based on the television series Mr. Robot, was developed by Night School Studio, the company's mobile debut, and published by Telltale. Following release, a ""Text"" mode, being co-developed by Telltale, was also included within the game as well.
Around this time, Telltale had acquired the rights to make a game based on the television show Stranger Things. While Telltale was planning its own adventure game, they contacted Night School to develop a companion game, a first-person narrative title that would serve as a lead-in to their game. Night School brought in four more staff to help with this game. However, over the course of 2017 and 2018, Telltale had several internal issues, leading to difficulties in communication between the Telltale and Night School teams, and failure of Telltale to pay for completed milestones. In October 2018, Telltale announced its surprise closure, leaving Night School's game in limbo. According to a source speaking to The Verge, Night School would have also suffered financial hardships if they had not been concurrently working on Afterparty as well.
Night School Studio was acquired by Netflix in September 2021, as part of Netflix's venture into video game offerings. The acquisition did not affect the studio's work on Oxenfree II.
With the release of the seventh season of Black Mirror, Night School developed a mobile version of the game Thronglets, which is used as a plot element within the episode ""Plaything"" in the season. The game was co-developed along with Charlie Brooker's production of the episode, such that the real-world game would feel as if it ""literally got lifted out of the episode"".

Controversy
In September 2024, Night School Studio removed Oxenfree from the Itch.io storefront and sent users who had purchased the game on the platform a message ",Netflix,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_School_Studio,0,night school studio llc american video game developer publisher founded june sean krankel adam hines based glendale california founding company team started development debut oxenfree setting casting call backstage team moved development game first footage game released may release set january soon game received positive review film adaptation plan skybound entertainment along telltale game night school studio also codeveloped text adventure mode mr robotexfiltratin called mr robotexfiltratinipa io mr robotexfiltratinapk android night school studio acquired netflix september part streaming service venture video game history night school studio founded october sean krankel cousin adam hines respectively former disney interactive studio telltale game developer setting company team decided develop new game soon casting call issued company backstage expired november march team posted video titled oxenfree official trailer onto youtube account group announced oxenfree march plot revolved around group teenager exploring decommissioned island surrounded ghost studio according krankel tight budget could make single game gameplay footage released may october second teaser released well game release slated january october interview koalition asked talking mechanic krankel saidif talking core mechanic game streamline talking process first stop taking player control away forcing player cut scene next put dialogue choice close player character possible dialogue choice really feel like extension avatar two design goal really drove lot creative choice everything camera placement art direction pacing gameon january launch trailer released day game released microsoft window o x xbox one within day skybound entertainment announced partnership night school studio web series entitled story oxenfree released detailing development game well film adaptation merchandise april company announced playstation version would released extended mode called game included version release released may linux version released june game received positive review critic selected indiecade hosted october – san francisco august mr robotexfiltratin mobile game based television series mr robot developed night school studio company mobile debut published telltale following release text mode codeveloped telltale also included within game well around time telltale acquired right make game based television show stranger thing telltale planning adventure game contacted night school develop companion game firstperson narrative title would serve leadin game night school brought four staff help game however course telltale several internal issue leading difficulty communication telltale night school team failure telltale pay completed milestone october telltale announced surprise closure leaving night school game limbo according source speaking verge night school would also suffered financial hardship concurrently working afterparty well night school studio acquired netflix september part netflixs venture video game offering acquisition affect studio work oxenfree ii release seventh season black mirror night school developed mobile version game thronglets used plot element within episode plaything season game codeveloped along charlie brookers production episode realworld game would feel literally got lifted episode controversy september night school studio removed oxenfree itchio storefront sent user purchased game platform message
Art Recognition,"Art Recognition is a Swiss technology company headquartered in Adliswil, within the Zurich metropolitan area, Switzerland. Specializing in the application of artificial intelligence (AI) for the purposes of art authentication and the detection of art forgeries, Art Recognition integrates advanced algorithms and computer vision technology. The company's operations extend globally, with a primary aim to increase transparency and security in the art market.

History
Art Recognition was established in 2019 by Dr. Carina Popovici and Christiane Hoppe-Oehl. The foundation of the company was driven by the long-standing challenge in the art world of authenticating paintings, a process traditionally reliant on expert judgment, historical research, and scientific analysis. Recognizing the limitations of existing methods, the co-founders were motivated by technological advancements in digital imaging and pattern recognition algorithms in the field of art.
These technological advancements, particularly in the realm of high-resolution digital imagery, enable a more detailed examination of artworks. By analyzing brushstrokes, signature patterns, and other distinct characteristics, and comparing them with known works by the same artist, digital tools offer a new dimension in authentication. Popovici and Hoppe-Oehl aimed to develop an advanced algorithm that could further assist experts by identifying stylistic elements and patterns unique to individual artists, thus aiding in the art authentication process.

Technology and methodology
Art Recognition employs a combination of machine learning techniques, computer vision algorithms, and deep neural networks to assess the authenticity of artworks. The AI algorithm analyzes various visual characteristics, such as brushstrokes, color palette, texture, and composition, to identify patterns and similarities with known authentic artworks.
The company's technology undergoes a process of data collection, dataset preparation, and training. After the testing phase, the AI algorithm is applied to analyze new images, including submissions from clients. Additionally, the algorithm is designed to identify artworks generated by generative AI, mimicking the style of renowned artists. This capability equips the algorithm to withstand adversarial attacks, enhancing its reliability in differentiating between authentic and artificially generated fake art pieces.

Academic partnerships and grants
Art Recognition's collaboration with Tilburg University in the Netherlands has resulted in the acquisition of a research grant from Eurostars, Eureka (organisation) the Eureka's flagship small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) funding program. In addition, the company has formed a partnership with the University of Liverpool in the United Kingdom, which has been supported by the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) Impact Acceleration Award. Furthermore, Art Recognition has established a relationship with Innosuisse, a Swiss innovation agency, to expand its research and development initiatives.
Art Recognition has formed a strategic collaboration with Nils Büttner, an art historian and professor at the State Academy of Fine Arts Stuttgart (ABK Stuttgart). By fostering dialogue between academic researchers and market professionals, the collaboration aims to refine existing authentication practices and introduce scientifically robust methodologies into the art sector.

Notable developments
In May 2024, Art Recognition played a key role in identifying counterfeit artworks, including alleged Monets and Renoirs, being sold on eBay. The findings contributed to a broader discussion on the role of AI in preventing art fraud, particularly in online marketplaces where traditional expertise is often lacking. The case underscored the increasing importance of AI as a fraud detection tool.
Germann Auction made history in November 2024 by becoming the first auction house to successfully conduct a sale of artwork authenticated entirely by artificial intelligence. This milestone reflects the increasing reliance on technological solutions in the art market, where AI-driven authentication processes provide data-backed evaluations of artwork authenticity.
The NHK WORLD-JAPAN news report examined the vulnerabilities of the Japanese art market to forgery, particularly in light of the Beltracchi scandal of the 1990s. During this period, Wolfgang Beltracchi successfully sold numerous counterfeit paintings to Japanese collectors, who only later discovered the deception. This case highlighted the challenges of authentication in the Asian art market, exposing weaknesses in provenance verification and expert assessment. The report explores how advancements in AI-based authentication, including the work of Art Recognition, are now being used to prevent similar fraud. Artificial intelligence is being integrated as a supplementary tool to traditional connoisseurship, aiming to enhance security in the global art trade.

Outline of painting,"Painting – artwork in which paint or other medium has been applied to a surface, and in which area and composition are two primary considerations.
The art of painting – act of creating paintings.

What type of thing is painting?
Painting can be described as all of the following:

Art – aesthetic expression for presentation or performance, and the work produced from this activity. The word ""art"" is therefore both a verb and a noun, as is the word ""painting"".
Work of art – aesthetic physical item or artistic creation. A painting is a work of art expressed in paint.
One of the arts – as an art form, painting is an outlet of human expression, that is usually influenced by culture and which in turn helps to change culture. Painting is a physical manifestation of the internal human creative impulse.
Fine art – in Western European academic traditions, fine art is art developed primarily for aesthetics, distinguishing it from applied art that also has to serve some practical function. The word ""fine"" here does not so much denote the quality of the artwork in question, but the purity of the discipline according to traditional Western European canons.
One of the visual arts – visual arts is a class of art forms, including painting, sculpture, photography, printmaking and others, that focus on the creation of works which are primarily visual in nature.

Styles of painting
Styles of painting by movement
Abstract expressionism – movement in painting, originating in New York City in the 1940s. It emphasized spontaneous personal expression, freedom from accepted artistic values, surface qualities of paint, and the act of painting itself. Pollock, de Kooning, Motherwell, and Kline, are important abstract expressionists.
Academic art – a style of painting and sculpture produced under the influence of European academies or universities. Specifically, academic art is the art and artists influenced by the standards of the French Académie des beaux-arts, which practiced under the movements of Neoclassicism and Romanticism, and the art that followed these two movements in the attempt to synthesize both of their styles.
Action painting – connected to the Abstract Expressionist movement, but more precise in its meaning, Action Painting believes in the expressive power held in the actual act of painting as much as in the finished product. Rosenberg defined the notion of the canvas as seen by the artists in this movement as being 'not a picture but an event'.
Art Deco – design style prevalent during the 1920s and 1930s, characterized by a sleek use of straight lines and slender form.
Art Nouveau – decorative art movement that emerged in the late nineteenth century. Characterized by dense asymmetrical ornamentation in sinuous forms, it is often symbolic and of an erotic nature. Klimt worked in an art nouveau style.
Baroque – movement in European painting in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, characterized by violent movement, strong emotion, and dramatic lighting and coloring. Bernini, Caravaggio and Rubens were among important baroque artists.
Bauhaus – school of art, design and architecture founded in Germany in 1919. Bauhaus style is characterized by its severely economic, geometric design and by its respect for materials. The Bauhaus school was created by Walter Gropius.
Byzantine – style of the Byzantine Empire and its provinces, c. 330–1450. Appearing mostly in religious mosaics, manuscript illuminations, and panel paintings, it is characterized by rigid, monumental, stylized forms with gold backgrounds.
Classicism – based on Greek and Roman art of antiquity with emphasis on harmony, proportion, balance, and simplicity.
Color field painting – technique in abstract painting developed in the 1950s. It focuses on the lyrical effects of large areas of color, often poured or stained onto the canvas. Newman, Rothko, and Frankenthaler painted in this manner.
Conceptual art – movement of the 1960s and 1970s that emphasized the artistic idea over the art object. It attempted to free art from the confines of the gallery and the pedestal.
Constructivism – Russian abstract movement founded by Tatlin, Gabo, and Antoine Pevsner, c. 1915. It focused on art for the industrial age. Tatlin believed in art with a utilitarian purpose.
Cubism – revolutionary movement begun by Picasso and Braque in the early twentieth century. It employs an analytic vision based on fragmentation and multiple viewpoints.
Empire style – sometimes considered the second phase of Neoclassicism, is an early 19th century design movement in architecture, furniture, other decorative arts, and the visual arts.
Dadaism – movement, c. 1915–1923, that rejected accepted aesthetic standards. It aimed to create antiart and nonart, often employing a sense of the absurd.

Toroidal solenoid,"The toroidal solenoid was an early 1946 design for a fusion power device designed by George Paget Thomson and Moses Blackman of Imperial College London. It proposed to confine a deuterium fuel plasma to a toroidal (donut-shaped) chamber using magnets, and then heating it to fusion temperatures using radio frequency energy in the fashion of a microwave oven. It is notable for being the first such design to be patented, filing a secret patent on 8 May 1946 and receiving it in 1948.
A critique by Rudolf Peierls noted several problems with the concept. Over the next few years, Thomson continued to suggest starting an experimental effort to study these issues, but was repeatedly denied as the underlying theory of plasma diffusion was not well developed. When similar concepts were suggested by Peter Thonemann that included a more practical heating arrangement, John Cockcroft began to take the concept more seriously, establishing small study groups at Harwell. Thomson adopted Thonemann's concept, abandoning the radio frequency system.
When the patent had still not been granted in early 1948, the Ministry of Supply inquired about Thomson's intentions. Thomson explained the problems he had getting a program started and that he did not want to hand off the rights until that was clarified. As the directors of the UK nuclear program, the Ministry quickly forced Harwell's hand to provide funding for Thomson's program. Thomson then released his rights the patent, which was granted late that year. Cockcroft also funded Thonemann's work, and with that, the UK fusion program began in earnest. After the news furor over the Huemul Project in February 1951, significant funding was released and led to rapid growth of the program in the early 1950s, and ultimately to the ZETA reactor of 1958.

Conceptual development
The basic understanding of nuclear fusion was developed during the 1920s as physicists explored the new science of quantum mechanics. George Gamow's 1928 work on quantum tunnelling demonstrated that nuclear reactions could take place at lower energies than classical theory predicted. Using this theory, in 1929 Fritz Houtermans and Robert Atkinson demonstrated that expected reaction rates in the core of the Sun supported Arthur Eddington's 1920 suggestion that the Sun is powered by fusion.
In 1934, Mark Oliphant, Paul Harteck and Ernest Rutherford were the first to achieve fusion on Earth, using a particle accelerator to shoot deuterium nuclei into a metal foil containing deuterium, lithium or other elements. This allowed them to measure the nuclear cross section of various fusion reactions, and determined that the deuterium-deuterium reaction occurred at a lower energy than other reactions, peaking at about 100,000 electronvolts (100 keV).
This energy corresponds to the average energy of particles in a gas heated to a billion Kelvin. Materials heated beyond a few tens of thousand Kelvin dissociate into their electrons and nuclei, producing a gas-like state of matter known as plasma. In any gas the particles have a wide range of energies, normally following the Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics. In such a mixture, a small number of particles will have much higher energy than the bulk.
This leads to an interesting possibility; even at temperatures well below 100,000 eV, some particles will randomly have enough energy to undergo fusion. Those reactions release huge amounts of energy. If that energy can be captured back into the plasma, it can heat other particles to that energy as well, making the reaction self-sustaining. In 1944, Enrico Fermi calculated this would occur at about 50,000,000 K.

Confinement
Taking advantage of this possibility requires the fuel plasma to be held together long enough that these random reactions have time to occur. Like any hot gas, the plasma has an internal pressure and thus tends to expand according to the ideal gas law. For a fusion reactor, the problem is keeping the plasma contained against this pressure; any known physical container would melt at temperatures in the thousands of Kelvin, far below the millions needed for fusion.
A plasma is electrically conductive, and is subject to electric and magnetic fields. In a magnetic field, the electrons and nuclei orbit the magnetic field lines. A simple confinement system is a plasma-filled tube placed inside the open core of a solenoid. The plasma naturally wants to expand outwards to the walls of the tube, as well as move along it, towards the ends. The solenoid creates a magnetic field running down the centre of the tube, which the particles will orbit, preventing their motion towards the sides. Unfortunately, this arrangement does not confine the plasma along the length of the tube, and the plasma is free to flow out the ends.

Initial design
The obvious solution to this problem is to bend the tube, and solenoid, around to form a torus (a ring or doughnut shape). Motion towards the sides remains constrained as before, and while the particl",Physics,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toroidal_solenoid,0,toroidal solenoid early design fusion power device designed george paget thomson moses blackman imperial college london proposed confine deuterium fuel plasma toroidal donutshaped chamber using magnet heating fusion temperature using radio frequency energy fashion microwave oven notable first design patented filing secret patent may receiving critique rudolf peierls noted several problem concept next year thomson continued suggest starting experimental effort study issue repeatedly denied underlying theory plasma diffusion well developed similar concept suggested peter thonemann included practical heating arrangement john cockcroft began take concept seriously establishing small study group harwell thomson adopted thonemanns concept abandoning radio frequency system patent still granted early ministry supply inquired thomson intention thomson explained problem getting program started want hand right clarified director uk nuclear program ministry quickly forced harwells hand provide funding thomson program thomson released right patent granted late year cockcroft also funded thonemanns work uk fusion program began earnest news furor huemul project february significant funding released led rapid growth program early ultimately zeta reactor conceptual development basic understanding nuclear fusion developed physicist explored new science quantum mechanic george gamow work quantum tunnelling demonstrated nuclear reaction could take place lower energy classical theory predicted using theory fritz houtermans robert atkinson demonstrated expected reaction rate core sun supported arthur eddington suggestion sun powered fusion mark oliphant paul harteck ernest rutherford first achieve fusion earth using particle accelerator shoot deuterium nucleus metal foil containing deuterium lithium element allowed measure nuclear cross section various fusion reaction determined deuteriumdeuterium reaction occurred lower energy reaction peaking electronvolts kev energy corresponds average energy particle gas heated billion kelvin material heated beyond ten thousand kelvin dissociate electron nucleus producing gaslike state matter known plasma gas particle wide range energy normally following maxwell–boltzmann statistic mixture small number particle much higher energy bulk lead interesting possibility even temperature well ev particle randomly enough energy undergo fusion reaction release huge amount energy energy captured back plasma heat particle energy well making reaction selfsustaining enrico fermi calculated would occur k confinement taking advantage possibility requires fuel plasma held together long enough random reaction time occur like hot gas plasma internal pressure thus tends expand according ideal gas law fusion reactor problem keeping plasma contained pressure known physical container would melt temperature thousand kelvin far million needed fusion plasma electrically conductive subject electric magnetic field magnetic field electron nucleus orbit magnetic field line simple confinement system plasmafilled tube placed inside open core solenoid plasma naturally want expand outwards wall tube well move along towards end solenoid creates magnetic field running centre tube particle orbit preventing motion towards side unfortunately arrangement confine plasma along length tube plasma free flow end initial design obvious solution problem bend tube solenoid around form torus ring doughnut shape motion towards side remains constrained particl
Antarctic gateway cities,"The Antarctic gateway cities are five cities on the rim of the Southern Ocean through which nearly all cargo and personnel bound for Antarctica pass. From west to east, they are Punta Arenas, Chile; Ushuaia, Argentina; Cape Town, South Africa; Hobart, Australia; and Christchurch, New Zealand. As Antarctica is a low-resource environment with no major transportation infrastructure of its own, gateway cities are a necessary part of all Antarctic activities.
Each of the gateway cities accommodates both planes and ships traveling to Antarctica, and generally services the areas of the continent closest to them. The cities are used by both national Antarctic programs and Antarctic commercial tourism companies, although they differ in how much of each they facilitate. As a result of their status as transportation hubs, the cities also have cultural, economic, ecological, and political connections to Antarctica.

History
Early Antarctic exploration
In the 1820s when mainland Antarctica was first discovered, the current gateway cities didn't have the infrastructure to support expeditions so ships departed from more northerly ports such as Valparaíso, Chile and Sydney, Australia. The current gateway cities began establishing themselves as important Antarctic supply hubs around the turn of the 20th Century when several of the most notable Heroic Age expeditions first traveled through them, beginning with the British Southern Cross Expedition in 1898.

21st century
Though the cities operated almost entirely independently through most of their history as Antarctic gateways, the cities have made efforts to build relationships with one another in the 21st century. In 2009, officials from each city met in Christchurch and signed a ""Statement of Intent Between the Southern Rim Gateway Cities to Antarctica"" to promote peaceful cooperation among the cities. The statement expired two and a half years later. From 2017 to 2020, an Australian-led project called Antarctic Cities recruited partners from each of the gateway cities to study their relationship with one another and with Antarctica. The project aimed to transition the cities from gateways, which participate in purely transportation activities, to custodial cities, which also participate in Antarctic stewardship activities. If geographic proximity to Antarctica is not considered necessary, other cities could also be called Antarctic gateways or become gateways in the future. For instance, Shanghai has a growing role through the Polar Research Institute of China and could potentially become recognized as a gateway city in the future.

Public relationship to Antarctica
A 2020 survey found that roughly three-quarters of respondents from each of the gateway cities felt Antarctica was ""very/fairly important to the city's identity."" A majority of respondents also reported feeling ""very/fairly responsible for Antarctica's future"" and that it was important for their city to develop a relationship with Antarctica to promote better care for the environment. In recent years the cities have seen efforts by municipal officials to promote stronger relationships with the continent, such as Antarctic festivals, education programs for K-12 students, museum exhibits, and public outreach campaigns.

Cities
Punta Arenas
Punta Arenas is located on the Southern Cone near the Antarctic Peninsula. More than 20 national Antarctic programs travel through Punta Arenas, more than any other gateway city. In 2016 the municipal government launched a project to increase infrastructure and promote a cultural connection to Antarctica.

Ushuaia
Ushuaia is the most southerly of the gateway cities and is located roughly 1000 km from the Antarctic Peninsula. Ushuaia is by far the most popular gateway city for tourism to Antarctica, accounting for 90% of all tourists to the continent. Nearly all of the passengers departing Ushuaia for Antarctica travel by cruise ship. It services Argentina's own National Antarctic Directorate, but no other national Antarctic program. It is also home to Antarctic-related tourism attractions, such as the Antarctic Museum.

Cape Town
Cape Town is the largest of the gateway cities and the farthest from Antarctica. In addition to South Africa's own national Antarctic program, the programs of Russia, Germany, Belgium, Norway, and Japan also reach Antarctica via Cape Town. As of 2021, tourism company White Desert has offered direct commercial flights from Cape Town to Antarctica.

Hobart
Hobart services the national Antarctic programs of Australia, France, and China. Hobart offers the least transportation to Antarctica among the gateway cities, but has the highest number of Antarctic scientists. It also houses several Antarctic policy and research organizations including the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies at the University of Tasmania, the Tasmanian Polar Network, and Antarctica Tasmania.

Chemical compound,"A chemical compound is a chemical substance composed of many identical molecules (or molecular entities) containing atoms from more than one chemical element held together by chemical bonds. A molecule consisting of atoms of only one element is therefore not a compound. A compound can be transformed into a different substance by a chemical reaction, which may involve interactions with other substances. In this process, bonds between atoms may be broken or new bonds formed or both.
There are four major types of compounds, distinguished by how the constituent atoms are bonded together. Molecular compounds are held together by covalent bonds; ionic compounds are held together by ionic bonds; intermetallic compounds are held together by metallic bonds; coordination complexes are held together by coordinate covalent bonds. Non-stoichiometric compounds form a disputed marginal case.
A chemical formula specifies the number of atoms of each element in a compound molecule, using the standard chemical symbols with numerical subscripts. Many chemical compounds have a unique CAS number identifier assigned by the Chemical Abstracts Service. Globally, more than 350,000 chemical compounds (including mixtures of chemicals) have been registered for production and use.

History of the concept
Robert Boyle
The term ""compound""—with a meaning similar to the modern—has been used at least since 1661 when Robert Boyle's The Sceptical Chymist was published. In this book, Boyle variously used the terms ""compound"", ""compounded body"", ""perfectly mixt body"", and ""concrete"". ""Perfectly mixt bodies"" included for example gold, lead, mercury, and wine. While the distinction between compound and mixture is not so clear, the distinction between element and compound is a central theme. Quicksilver ... with Aqua fortis will be brought into a ... white Powder ... with Sulphur it will compose a blood-red and volatile Cinaber. And yet out of all these exotick Compounds, we may recover the very same running Mercury.

Corpuscles of elements and compounds
Boyle used the concept of ""corpuscles""—or ""atomes"", as he also called them—to explain how a limited number of elements could combine into a vast number of compounds:If we assigne to the Corpuscles, whereof each Element consists, a peculiar size and shape ... such ... Corpuscles may be mingled in such various Proportions, and ... connected so many ... wayes, that an almost incredible number of ... Concretes may be compos’d of them.

Isaac Watts
In his Logick, published in 1724, the English minister and logician Isaac Watts gave an early definition of chemical element, and contrasted element with chemical compound in clear, modern terms.

Among Substances, some are called Simple, some are Compound ... Simple Substances ... are usually called Elements, of which all other Bodies are compounded: Elements are such Substances as cannot be resolved, or reduced, into two or more Substances of different Kinds. ... Followers of Aristotle made Fire, Air, Earth and Water to be the four Elements, of which all earthly Things were compounded; and they suppos'd the Heavens to be a Quintessence, or fifth sort of Body, distinct from all these : But, since experimental Philosophy ... have been better understood, this Doctrine has been abundantly refuted. The Chymists make Spirit, Salt, Sulphur, Water and Earth to be their five Elements, because they can reduce all terrestrial Things to these five : This seems to come nearer the Truth ; tho' they are not all agreed ... 
Compound Substances are made up of two or more simple Substances ... So a Needle is simple Body, being made only of Steel; but a Sword or a Knife is a compound because its ... Handle is made of Materials different from the Blade.

Definitions
Any substance consisting of two or more different types of atoms (chemical elements) in a fixed stoichiometric proportion can be termed a chemical compound; the concept is most readily understood when considering pure chemical substances.: 15  It follows from their being composed of fixed proportions of two or more types of atoms that chemical compounds can be converted, via chemical reaction, into compounds or substances each having fewer atoms. A chemical formula is a way of expressing information about the proportions of atoms that constitute a particular chemical compound, using chemical symbols for the chemical elements, and subscripts to indicate the number of atoms involved. For example, water is composed of two hydrogen atoms bonded to one oxygen atom: the chemical formula is H2O. In the case of non-stoichiometric compounds, the proportions may be reproducible with regard to their preparation, and give fixed proportions of their component elements, but proportions that are not integral [e.g., for palladium hydride, PdHx (0.02 < x < 0.58)].
Chemical compounds have a unique and defined chemical structure held together in a defined spatial arrangement by chemical bonds.

Painting,"Painting is a visual art, which is characterized by the practice of applying paint, pigment, color or other medium to a solid surface (called ""matrix"" or ""support""). The medium is commonly applied to the base with a brush. Other implements, such as palette knives, sponges, airbrushes, the artist's fingers, or even a dripping technique that uses gravity may be used. One who produces paintings is called a painter.
In art, the term ""painting"" describes both the act and the result of the action (the final work is called ""a painting""). The support for paintings includes such surfaces as walls, paper, canvas, wood, glass, lacquer, pottery, leaf, copper and concrete, and the painting may incorporate other materials, in single or multiple form, including sand, clay, paper, cardboard, newspaper, plaster, gold leaf, and even entire objects.
Painting is an important form of visual art, bringing in elements such as drawing, composition, gesture, narration, and abstraction. Paintings can be naturalistic and representational (as in portraits, still life and landscape painting--though these genres can also be abstract), photographic, abstract, narrative, symbolist (as in Symbolist art), emotive (as in Expressionism) or political in nature (as in Artivism).
A significant share of the history of painting in both Eastern and Western art is dominated by religious art. Examples of this kind of painting range from artwork depicting mythological figures on pottery, to Biblical scenes on the Sistine Chapel ceiling, to scenes from the life of Buddha (or other images of Eastern religious origin).

History
The oldest known paintings are more than 40,000-60,000 years old (art of the Upper Paleolithic) and found in the caves in the district of Maros (Sulawesi, Indonesia). The oldest are often constructed from hand stencils and simple geometric shapes.

In November 2018, scientists reported the discovery of the then-oldest known figurative art painting, over 40,000 (perhaps as old as 52,000) years old, of an unknown animal, in the cave of Lubang Jeriji Saléh on the Indonesian island of Borneo. In December 2019, cave paintings portraying pig hunting within the Maros-Pangkep karst region in Sulawesi were discovered to be even older, with an estimated age of at least 43,900 years. This finding was recognized as ""the oldest known depiction of storytelling and the earliest instance of figurative art in human history."" In 2021, cave art of a pig found in Sulawesi, Indonesia, and dated to over 45,500 years ago, has been reported. On July 3, 2024, the journal Nature published research findings indicating that the cave paintings which depict anthropomorphic figures interacting with a pig and measure 36 by 15 inches (91 by 38 cm) in Leang Karampuang are approximately 51,200 years old, establishing them as the oldest known paintings in the world.
There are examples of cave paintings all over the world—in Indonesia, France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, China, India, Australia, Mexico, etc. In Western cultures, oil painting and watercolor painting have rich and complex traditions in style and subject matter. In the East, ink and color ink historically predominated the choice of media, with equally rich and complex traditions.
The invention of photography had a major impact on painting. In the decades after the first photograph was produced in 1829, photographic processes improved and became more widely practiced, depriving painting of much of its historic purpose to provide an accurate record of the observable world. A series of art movements in the late 19th and early 20th centuries—notably Impressionism, Post-Impressionism, Fauvism, Expressionism, Cubism, and Dadaism—challenged the Renaissance view of the world. Eastern and African painting, however, continued a long history of stylization and did not undergo an equivalent transformation at the same time.
Modern and Contemporary art has moved away from the historic value of craft and documentation in favour of concept. This has not deterred the majority of living painters from continuing to practice painting either as a whole or part of their work. The vitality and versatility of painting in the 21st century defy the previous ""declarations"" of its demise. In an epoch characterized by the idea of pluralism, there is no consensus as to a representative style of the age. Artists continue to make important works of art in a wide variety of styles and aesthetic temperaments—their merits are left to the public and the marketplace to judge.
The Feminist art movement began in the 1960s during the second wave of feminism. The movement sought to gain equal rights and equal opportunities for female artists internationally.

List of modern great powers,"A great power is a nation, state or empire that, through its economic, political and military strength, is able to exert power and influence not only over its own region of the world, but beyond to others. A great power typically possesses military, economic, and diplomatic strength that it can wield to influence the actions of middle or small powers.
In a modern context, recognized great powers first arose in Europe during the post-Napoleonic era. The formalization of the division between small powers and great powers came about with the signing of the Treaty of Chaumont in 1814.
The historical terms ""Great Nation"", a distinguished aggregate of people inhabiting a particular country or territory, and ""Great Empire"", a considerable group of states or countries under a single supreme authority, are colloquial; their use is seen in ordinary historical conversations.

Early modern great powers
France (1214–)
France has been one of the leading powers in Europe and the world, since the breakup of the Carolingian Empire and the emergence of West Francia, its predecessor state, although its power was only truly consolidated from 1214 onwards with its victory in the Anglo-French War. Over the 14th century, French kings would focus on bringing more of the kingdom's lands under their direct control, as France emerged as the most populous region in Europe by 1340. After the discovery of the New World, France became a dominant empire possessing many colonies in various locations around the world. Still participating in his deadly Italian conflicts, Francis I of France managed to finance expeditions to find trade routes to China or Cathay through landmass already discovered by the Spanish under Giovanni da Verrazzano. Giovanni would lead the first French discovery of the ""New World"" just north of the Spanish invasions of Mesoamerica later as New Spain and a decade later Jacques Cartier would firmly colonize the landmass in the name of Francis I. This New World colony would become New France, the first colony of the Kingdom of France. In the 1500s, France was still the most populous country in Europe, and would remain so until the mid-19th to late 19th century. During the reign of Louis XIV, the Sun King, from 1643 to 1715, France was the leading European power as Europe's richest and most powerful country. The dominance of France over world affairs extended to most foreign European courts speaking French, including other great powers of the time such as England, Sweden, and Russia.
From the 16th to the 17th centuries, the first French colonial empire stretched over a total area, at its peak in 1680, of up to 10 million km2 (3.9 million sq mi), the second-largest empire in the world at the time behind only the Spanish Empire (which France would also take control of, briefly, under Napoleon). It had many possessions around the world, mainly in the Americas, Asia and Africa. France kept some of these possessions to this day, integrating them into its territory, like La Réunion. At its peak in 1750, French India had an area of 1.5 million km2 (0.58 million sq mi) and a totaled population of 30 million people, making it the most populous colony under French rule.
At the onset of the French Revolutionary Wars, early French victories exported many ideological features of the French Revolution throughout Europe. Napoleon gained support by appealing to some common concerns of the people. In France, these included fear by some of a restoration of the ancien régime, a dislike of the Bourbons and the emigrant nobility who had escaped the country, a suspicion of foreign kings who had tried to reverse the Revolution – and a wish by Jacobins to extend France's revolutionary ideals.
Napoleon became Emperor of the French (French: L'Empereur des Français) on 18 May 1804 and crowned Emperor on 2 December 1804, ending the period of the French Consulate, and won early military victories in the Napoleonic Wars against most European allied nations, notably at the Battle of Austerlitz (1805) and the Battle of Friedland (1807). Subsequent years of military victories extended French influence over much of Western Europe and into Poland. At its height in 1812, the French Empire had 134 départements, ruled over 90 million subjects, maintained extensive military presence in Germany, Italy, Spain, and the Duchy of Warsaw, and could count Prussia, Russia and Austria as nominal allies. The First French Empire (1804–1814, 1815), otherwise known as the Napoleonic Empire, was also the dominant power of much of continental Europe, and ruled over 90 million people at its height. It was the preeminent power in Europe, if not the world, as Britain was its only rival during the early 19th century, the two countries battling for supremacy over the world, with France dominating on land and Britain on the sea.

Mountain range,"A mountain range or hill range is a series of mountains or hills arranged in a line and connected by high ground. A mountain system or mountain belt is a group of mountain ranges with similarity in form, structure, and alignment that have arisen from the same cause, usually an orogeny. Mountain ranges are formed by a variety of geological processes, but most of the significant ones on Earth are the result of plate tectonics. Mountain ranges are also found on many planetary mass objects in the Solar System and are likely a feature of most terrestrial planets.
Mountain ranges are usually segmented by highlands or mountain passes and valleys. Individual mountains within the same mountain range do not necessarily have the same geologic structure or petrology. They may be a mix of different orogenic expressions and terranes, for example thrust sheets, uplifted blocks, fold mountains, and volcanic landforms resulting in a variety of rock types.

Major ranges
Most geologically young mountain ranges on the Earth's land surface are associated with either the Pacific Ring of Fire or the Alpide belt. The Pacific Ring of Fire includes the Andes of South America, extends through the North American Cordillera, the Aleutian Range, on through Kamchatka Peninsula, Japan, China, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, to New Zealand. The Andes is 7,000 kilometres (4,350 mi) long and is often considered the world's longest mountain system.
The Alpide belt stretches 15,000 km across southern Eurasia, from Java in Maritime Southeast Asia to the Iberian Peninsula in Western Europe, including the ranges of the Himalayas, Karakoram, Hindu Kush, Alborz, Caucasus, and the Alps. The Himalayas contain the highest mountains in the world, including Mount Everest, which is 8,848 metres (29,029 ft) high.
Mountain ranges outside these two systems include the Arctic Cordillera, Appalachians, Great Dividing Range, East Siberians, Altais, Scandinavians, Qinling, Western Ghats, Vindhyas, Byrrangas, and the Annamite Range. If the definition of a mountain range is stretched to include underwater mountains, then the Ocean Ridge forms the longest continuous mountain system on Earth, with a length of 65,000 kilometres (40,400 mi).

Climate
The position of mountain ranges influences climate, such as rain or snow. When air masses move up and over mountains, the air cools, producing orographic precipitation (rain or snow). As the air descends on the leeward side, it warms again (following the adiabatic lapse rate) and is drier, having been stripped of much of its moisture. Often, a rain shadow will affect the leeward side of a range. As a consequence, large mountain ranges, such as the Andes, compartmentalize continents into distinct climate regions.

Erosion
Mountain ranges are constantly subjected to erosional forces which work to tear them down. The basins adjacent to an eroding mountain range are then filled with sediments that are buried and turned into sedimentary rock. Erosion is at work while the mountains are being uplifted until the mountains are reduced to low hills and plains.
The early Cenozoic uplift of the Rocky Mountains of Colorado provides an example. As the uplift was occurring some 10,000 feet (3,000 m) of mostly Mesozoic sedimentary strata were removed by erosion over the core of the mountain range and spread as sand and clays across the Great Plains to the east. This mass of rock was removed as the range was actively undergoing uplift. The removal of such a mass from the core of the range most likely caused further uplift as the region adjusted isostatically in response to the removed weight.
Rivers are traditionally believed to be the principal cause of mountain range erosion, by cutting into bedrock and transporting sediment. Computer simulation has shown that as mountain belts change from tectonically active to inactive, the rate of erosion drops because there are fewer abrasive particles in the water and fewer landslides.

Extraterrestrial ""Montes""
Mountains on other planets and natural satellites of the Solar System, including the Moon, are often isolated and formed mainly by processes such as impacts, though there are examples of mountain ranges (or ""Montes"") somewhat similar to those on Earth. Saturn's moon Titan and Pluto, in particular, exhibit large mountain ranges in chains composed mainly of ices rather than rock. Examples include the Mithrim Montes and Doom Mons on Titan, and Tenzing Montes and Hillary Montes on Pluto. Some terrestrial planets other than Earth also exhibit rocky mountain ranges, such as Maxwell Montes on Venus taller than any on Earth and Tartarus Montes on Mars. Jupiter's moon Io has mountain ranges formed from tectonic processes including the Boösaule, Dorian, Hi'iaka and Euboea Montes.

Sociology of film,"The sociology of film deals with the sociological analysis of film.  According to a university class in it, the field includes ""Contemporary cinema as a culture clue to social change; an introduction to the social forces involved in film-making in the United States and other cultures; the influence of films on mass and select audiences."" According to another university course, it covers ""social aspects causes and consequences of the production, distribution, content, form and reception of film.""
The New York Times said, ""One problem, though, is that if the audience is the measure all things, then art becomes a reflection of sociology and dissecting audience tastes becomes the art.""

Netflix and chill,"""Netflix and chill"" is an Internet slang term used as a euphemism for sexual activity, either as part of a romantic partnership, as casual sex, or as a groupie invitation. Since its first recorded, nonsexual use in a tweet posted in 2009, the phrase has gained popularity within the Twitter community and other social media sites like Facebook and Vine. By 2015, ""Netflix and chill"" had become an Internet meme and its use on teenage social media was commonly described as ""sexual"" by Fusion.
The phrase usually is a request to be in one another's company and then engaging in sexual activity.

History
Origins
The first recorded use of the phrase ""Netflix and chill"" was in a Twitter post by ""NoFaceNina"" (La Shanda Rene Foster) on January 21, 2009. It said: ""I'm about to log onto Netflix and chill for the rest of the night."" Early use of the phrase was without sexual connotations, referring simply to the act of watching the online streaming service, typically by oneself. By 2013, Netflix's popularity in the US had risen greatly, having accumulated millions of paid subscribers, increasing verb use of the brand and this phrase as a standalone compound noun.
The euphemistic nature of the phrase is believed to have been established in mid-2014, and by the end of the year had spread throughout the Black Twitter community, as seen by many now typing chill within scare quotes. In April 2015, a definition of the phrase was added to Urban Dictionary stating that it meant ""code for two people going to each other's houses and [having sexual intercourse] or doing other sexual related acts"". Soon, the term would spread beyond the Black Twitter community, becoming an Internet meme and gaining the attention of news websites such as The Guardian and the Daily Mirror.

Impact
As the phrase entered into common lexicon, events, products, and services associated with the phrase started to emerge, including acknowledgement from Netflix itself.
In September 2015, a joke app in the style of Tinder had been created for users to organize ""Netflix and chill"" sessions. At two separate universities, students planned ""Netflix and chill"" festivals, with one being canceled by authorities as they believed too many people would be in attendance. During the 2015 World Maker Faire in New York City, Netflix unveiled a prototype for a large button called ""The Switch"", which, when pressed, will dim the lights in the users' residence, activate the ""Do Not Disturb"" feature on their cell phones, and prepare Netflix for streaming—eliminating most distractions from their activities. This has been frequently referred to as the ""Netflix and chill button"".
In October 2015, entrepreneur Kori Williams created and sold a line of condoms named Netflix and Chill.
In November 2015, the Netflix logo outside the company's headquarters in Los Gatos, California had been spray-painted to add the words ""and chill"".
In December 2015, Ariana Grande released the holiday EP Christmas & Chill, its title a seasonal variation on ""Netflix and chill"".
In January 2016, artist Tom Galle and company ART404 created a ""Netflix & Chill Room"" in New York City for rent on Airbnb.
In early February 2016, Netflix released the results of a survey on how users in relationships use their service, described as a ""Netflix and chill study"". The results were accompanied with a series of social media posts with the hashtag ""#DatingWithNetflix"" promoting the idea of a positive impact for couples using the service.
In June 2016, singer-songwriter Danah released a song titled ""Netflix and Chill"" on SoundCloud. The track was produced by Wippy Lion, a member of Australian pop group Justice Crew. The song is a tongue-in-cheek representation of the term's use in popular culture.
In January 2020, Ben & Jerry's announced a new ice cream flavor called ""Netflix & Chilll'd"".
""Netflix and chill"" inspired the name Stream and Chill for the Danish radio talk-show about streaming and TV-series. Stream and Chill is a Radio4 original program with radiohost William Ejsing. Stream and Chill has been on air since 2019.
""RBB and chill"" is a spoof of ""Netflix and chill"", used as a commercial slogan by the regional Public Service Broadcaster Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg in the north-east of Germany, mainly on billboards across the German capital of Berlin.

Quasi-isodynamic stellarator,"A quasi-isodynamic (QI) stellarator is a type of stellarator (a magnetic confinement fusion reactor) that satisfies the property of omnigeneity, avoids the potentially hazardous toroidal bootstrap current, and has minimal neoclassical transport in the collisionless regime.
Wendelstein 7-X, the largest stellarator in the world, was designed to be roughly quasi-isodynamic (QI).
In contrast to quasi-symmetric fields, exactly QI fields on flux surfaces cannot be expressed analytically. However, it has been shown that nearly-exact QI can be extremely well approximated through mathematical optimization, and that the resulting fields enjoy the aforementioned properties.
In a QI field, level curves of the magnetic field strength

Figure study,"A figure study is a drawing or painting of the human body made in preparation for a more composed or finished work; or to learn drawing and painting techniques in general and the human figure in particular. By preference, figure studies are done from a live model, but may also include the use of other references and the imagination of the artist. The live model may be clothed, or nude, but is usually nude for student work in order to learn human anatomy, or by professionals who establish the underlying anatomy before adding clothing in the final work.
A related term in sculpture is a maquette, a small scale model or rough draft of a proposed work. Drawings may also be preparatory for sculptural work.
Preparatory studies may be compositional, representing the entire proposed work, or may only be of certain details, such as hands and feet. Studies may be sketches completed in a relatively short length of time, or very detailed depending upon the artist's preferred methods. Drawings may concentrate on shapes and form, while studies in painting media are about color and lighting.
The term figure study is sometimes used in photography, but does not seem to be clearly defined as different from nude photography in general, given the inherently finished nature of the medium. Photography students may do work that is for educational purposes, and an artist may take photographs with the intent of using them as references for paintings, but the terms figure study or nude study is usually not limited to these preparatory or educational photos. This usage may have begun in the 19th century, when some photographers called their nude images ""studies for artists"" merely to evade the censors.

Education
Beginning in the Renaissance drawing the figure from life has been considered the best way to learn how to draw, and the practice has been maintained into the present. Different drawing techniques and exercises have become standard, including gesture, contour, and mass drawings. For beginners first learning to draw, learning to correctly observe real objects is essential in order to learn three dimensional perspective and the effects of lighting. Live models are preferred but if not available, plaster casts of the figure may be used, never photographs.

Open drawing groups
Experienced artists continue to practice drawing the figure long after their formal education is completed by attending informal groups with no instruction that meet, often weekly, to share the cost of hiring a model. Known by various names, such as sketch groups, figure sessions, etc.; the format is similar to beginning or intermediate drawing classes, being three hours in total that start with a number of gestures and proceed to slightly longer poses, but rarely more than 20 minutes each, only time enough for studies. Such open drawing groups can be found in many locals in the United States, and in other countries that share the Western tradition of figure studies.

Preparatory
During the 16th to the 19th centuries, painters did numerous drawings and color studies in preparation for large works that might take a year or more to complete. Since the late 19th century studies have become less important as painters adopted of the wet-on-wet, or alla prima painting technique, in which layers of wet paint are applied to previous layers of wet paint, the sketch being merely the first layer. However, the use of studies has been maintained by the academic art tradition.

Chemical equation,"A chemical equation is the symbolic representation of a chemical reaction in the form of symbols and chemical formulas. The reactant entities are given on the left-hand side and the product entities are on the right-hand side with a plus sign between the entities in both the reactants and the products, and an arrow that points towards the products to show the direction of the reaction. The chemical formulas may be symbolic, structural (pictorial diagrams), or intermixed. The coefficients next to the symbols and formulas of entities are the absolute values of the stoichiometric numbers. The first chemical equation was diagrammed by Jean Beguin in 1615.

Structure
A chemical equation (see an example below) consists of a list of reactants (the starting substances) on the left-hand side, an arrow symbol, and a list of products (substances formed in the chemical reaction) on the right-hand side. Each substance is specified by its chemical formula, optionally preceded by a number called stoichiometric coefficient. The coefficient specifies how many entities (e.g. molecules) of that substance are involved in the reaction on a molecular basis. If not written explicitly, the coefficient is equal to 1. Multiple substances on any side of the equation are separated from each other by a plus sign.
As an example, the equation for the reaction of hydrochloric acid with sodium can be denoted:

2HCl + 2Na  →  2NaCl + H2
Given the formulas are fairly simple, this equation could be read as ""two H-C-L plus two N-A yields two N-A-C-L and H two."" Alternately, and in general for equations involving complex chemicals, the chemical formulas are read using IUPAC nomenclature, which could verbalise this equation as ""two hydrochloric acid molecules and two sodium atoms react to form two formula units of sodium chloride and a hydrogen gas molecule.""

Reaction types
Different variants of the arrow symbol are used to denote the type of a reaction:

State of matter
To indicate physical state of a chemical, a symbol in parentheses may be appended to its formula: (s) for a solid, (l) for a liquid, (g) for a gas, and (aq) for an aqueous solution. This is especially done when one wishes to emphasize the states or changes thereof. For example, the reaction of aqueous hydrochloric acid with solid (metallic) sodium to form aqueous sodium chloride and hydrogen gas would be written like this:

2HCl(aq) + 2Na(s)  →  2NaCl(aq) + H2(g)
That reaction would have different thermodynamic and kinetic properties if gaseous hydrogen chloride were to replace the hydrochloric acid as a reactant:

2HCl(g) + 2Na(s)  →  2NaCl(s) + H2(g)
Alternately, an arrow without parentheses is used in some cases to indicate formation of a gas ↑ or precipitate ↓. This is especially useful if only one such species is formed. Here is an example indicating that hydrogen gas is formed:

2HCl + 2Na  →  2 NaCl + H2 ↑

Catalysis and other conditions
If the reaction requires energy, it is indicated above the arrow. A capital Greek letter delta (Δ) or a triangle (△) is put on the reaction arrow to show that energy in the form of heat is added to the reaction. The expression hν is used as a symbol for the addition of energy in the form of light. Other symbols are used for other specific types of energy or radiation. 
Similarly, if a reaction requires a certain medium with certain specific characteristics, then the name of the acid or base that is used as a medium may be placed on top of the arrow. If no specific acid or base is required, another way of denoting the use of an acidic or basic medium is to write H+ or OH− (or even ""acid"" or ""base"") on top of the arrow. Specific conditions of the temperature and pressure, as well as the presence of catalysts, may be indicated in the same way.

Notation variants
The standard notation for chemical equations only permits all reactants on one side, all products on the other, and all stoichiometric coefficients positive. For example, the usual form of the equation for dehydration of methanol to dimethylether is:

2 CH3OH  →  CH3OCH3 + H2O
Sometimes an extension is used, where some substances with their stoichiometric coefficients are moved above or below the arrow, preceded by a plus sign or nothing for a reactant, and by a minus sign for a product. Then the same equation can look like this:

City district,"A city district, also known as an urban district or neighbourhood, is a designated administrative division that is generally managed by a local government. It is used to divide a city into several administrative units.
City districts are used in Russia (raion), Pakistan and Croatia (Croatian: gradski kotar or gradska četvrt).
The term is also the English translation for the German Stadtbezirk; French arrondissements; Dutch stadsdeel; Swedish  stadsdel and Polish dzielnica.

By country/region
Russia (raion)
In Russia, a city district (raion) is a second-level administrative unit used to divide a city. It is the standardised administration unit of numerous post-Soviet states, two levels below national subdivision.

Germany (Stadtbezirk)
In Germany, a city district (Stadtbezirk) is an administrative unit that divides a metropolis of more than 150,000 inhabitants.

France and Francophonie (arrondissements)
A city district, or municipal arrondissement (French: arrondissement municipal [aʁɔ̃dismɑ̃ mynisipal]), is a subdividing unit used in France's three largest cities: Paris, Lyon and Marseille. It divides a commune within which it has its own mayor.
An arrondissement is also a term used for administrative divisions in areas such as Belgium, Haiti, and other certain Francophone countries.

Mexico City (borough)
There are 16 city districts of Mexico City: 15 subdivisions formally known as boroughs, and the Distrito Federal ('federal district').

Plasmaron,"In physics, the plasmaron was proposed by Lundqvist in 1967 as a quasiparticle arising in a system that has strong plasmon-electron interactions. In the original work, the plasmaron was proposed to describe a secondary peak (or satellite) in the photoemission spectral function of the electron gas. More precisely it was defined as an additional zero of the quasi-particle equation

. The same authors pointed out, in a subsequent work, that this extra solution might be an artifact of the used approximations:

We want to stress again that the discussion we have given of the one-electron spectrum is based on the assumption that vertex corrections are small. As discussed in the next section recent work by Langreth [29] shows that vertex corrections in the core electron problem can have a quite large effect on the form of satellite structures, while their effect on the quasi particle properties seems to be small. Preliminary investigations by one of us (L.H.) show similar strong vertex effects on the conduction band satellite. The details of the plasmaron structure should thus not be taken very seriously. A more mathematical discussion is provided.
The plasmaron was also studied in more recent works in the literature. It was shown, also with the support of the numerical simulations, that the plasmaron energy is an artifact of the approximation used to numerically compute the spectral function, e.g. solution of the dyson equation for the many body green function with a frequency dependent GW self-energy. This approach give rise to a wrong plasmaron peak instead of the plasmon satellite which can be measured experimentally.
Despite this fact, experimental observation of a plasmaron was reported in 2010 for graphene.
Also supported by earlier theoretical work. However subsequent works discussed that the theoretical interpretation of the experimental measure was not correct, in agreement with the fact that the plasmaron is only an artifact of the GW self-energy used with the Dyson equation. The artificial nature of the plasmaron peak was also proven via the comparison of experimental and numerical simulations for the photo-emission spectrum of bulk silicon. Other works on plasmaron have been published in the literature.
Observation of plasmaron peaks have also been reported in optical measurements of elemental bismuth and in other optical measurements.

Conservation and restoration of panel paintings,"The conservation-restoration of panel paintings involves preventive and treatment measures taken by paintings conservators to slow deterioration, preserve, and repair damage. Panel paintings consist of a wood support, a ground (linen or parchment sized with glues, resin, and gesso), and an image layer (encaustic, tempera, oil). They are typically constructed of two or more panels joined together by crossbeam braces which can separate due to age and material instability caused by fluctuations in relative humidity and temperature. These factors compromise structural integrity and can lead to warping and paint flaking. Because wood is particularly susceptible to pest damage, an IPM plan and regulation of the conditions in storage and display are essential. Past treatments that have fallen out of favor because they can cause permanent damage include transfer of the painting onto a new support, planing, and heavy cradling. Today's conservators often have to remediate damage from previous restoration efforts. Modern conservation-restoration techniques favor minimal intervention that accommodates wood's natural tendency to react to environmental changes. Treatments may include applying flexible battens to minimize deformation or simply leaving distortions alone, instead focusing on preventive care to preserve the artwork in its original state.

Preventive care
Preventive conservation involves the mitigation of potential threats to the stability of an artifact or specimen through a number of means. Threats such as fire, flood, natural disaster, physical force, and theft cannot be foreseen and inherent vice can only be addressed through prudent risk management, care, and handling of museum objects.
Conservation and curatorial staff can mitigate risks by correcting improper storage conditions which may lead to damage from pests, water, humidity, and mold. These issues can be further catalyzed by regional and seasonal environmental fluctuations and pollution. Proper handling protocols can help prevent chemical damage caused by contact with skin oils and structural damage from physical stress. Deterioration also occurs as a result of light exposure when objects are examined, exhibited, photographed, and transported.

Environmental conditions
Fluctuating humidity and temperatures can lead to structural damage of a painted surface due to long-term cumulative damage. In panels that are made up of multiple pieces of wood composing the larger surface area, the damage is most often visible where the pieces of wood are attached. Temperatures should range between +/- 5% of 70 °F and the humidity between +/- 5% of 50% Relative Humidity. A Relative Humidity over 65% can lead to mold growth and dry rot.
Panel paintings are subjected to various environmental conditions during exhibition. Regulating temperature, relative humidity, light intensity and duration of exposure, and atmospheric pollutants are essential factors in painting conservation. Air filtration via HVAC systems can reduce gases and airborne pollutants within exhibition spaces and storage areas. Maintaining light levels as low as possible, between 50–150 Lux, will minimize cumulative and irreversible light damage.

Integrated pest management
Integrated Pest Management policies are created to reduce or limit any problems relating to pests damaging objects within collections. Basic concepts discussed in Integrated Pest Management Policies include restricting food and sugary drink consumption in exhibition, storage areas and surrounding areas along with maintaining cleanliness in exhibition and storage areas. As noted, storage also comes into play when it comes to pest management, climate control, assessment of HVAC systems, and contamination due to exposure.

Handling
Prior to any handling, an examination of the work should be completed, including looking for signs of weakened structure and material stability. Both the painting and the space to which it is being transferred should be measured. These notes should be shared with preparators, registrars, and curatorial staff. The recommended handling method for panel paintings is similar to that of canvas and other two-dimensional works. Conservators are the only persons that should touch the front or back of a painting. The panel should be held by the edges using nitrile gloves and carried with two hands or in tandem by two people, depending on size. Paintings should never be handled more than one at a time. The procedure includes planning the move, handling, and communication with staff. Painting carts and other tools may be used, including a pallet jack or furniture dolly for moving a panel within a crate. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Canadian Conservation Institute, and the Australian Institute for the Conservation of Cultural Material provide general guidelines on proper care and handling.

Storage
Typical storage units in museums include sliding screens or slotted shelves made out of MDF and heat-treated wood",Painting,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_and_restoration_of_panel_paintings,0,conservationrestoration panel painting involves preventive treatment measure taken painting conservator slow deterioration preserve repair damage panel painting consist wood support ground linen parchment sized glue resin gesso image layer encaustic tempera oil typically constructed two panel joined together crossbeam brace separate due age material instability caused fluctuation relative humidity temperature factor compromise structural integrity lead warping paint flaking wood particularly susceptible pest damage ipm plan regulation condition storage display essential past treatment fallen favor cause permanent damage include transfer painting onto new support planing heavy cradling today conservator often remediate damage previous restoration effort modern conservationrestoration technique favor minimal intervention accommodates wood natural tendency react environmental change treatment may include applying flexible batten minimize deformation simply leaving distortion alone instead focusing preventive care preserve artwork original state preventive care preventive conservation involves mitigation potential threat stability artifact specimen number mean threat fire flood natural disaster physical force theft foreseen inherent vice addressed prudent risk management care handling museum object conservation curatorial staff mitigate risk correcting improper storage condition may lead damage pest water humidity mold issue catalyzed regional seasonal environmental fluctuation pollution proper handling protocol help prevent chemical damage caused contact skin oil structural damage physical stress deterioration also occurs result light exposure object examined exhibited photographed transported environmental condition fluctuating humidity temperature lead structural damage painted surface due longterm cumulative damage panel made multiple piece wood composing larger surface area damage often visible piece wood attached temperature range °f humidity relative humidity relative humidity lead mold growth dry rot panel painting subjected various environmental condition exhibition regulating temperature relative humidity light intensity duration exposure atmospheric pollutant essential factor painting conservation air filtration via hvac system reduce gas airborne pollutant within exhibition space storage area maintaining light level low possible – lux minimize cumulative irreversible light damage integrated pest management integrated pest management policy created reduce limit problem relating pest damaging object within collection basic concept discussed integrated pest management policy include restricting food sugary drink consumption exhibition storage area surrounding area along maintaining cleanliness exhibition storage area noted storage also come play come pest management climate control assessment hvac system contamination due exposure handling prior handling examination work completed including looking sign weakened structure material stability painting space transferred measured note shared preparators registrar curatorial staff recommended handling method panel painting similar canvas twodimensional work conservator person touch front back painting panel held edge using nitrile glove carried two hand tandem two people depending size painting never handled one time procedure includes planning move handling communication staff painting cart tool may used including pallet jack furniture dolly moving panel within crate metropolitan museum art canadian conservation institute australian institute conservation cultural material provide general guideline proper care handling storage typical storage unit museum include sliding screen slotted shelf made mdf heattreated wood
Futurism (literature),"Futurism is a modernist avant-garde movement in literature and part of the Futurism art movement that originated in Italy in the early 20th century. It made its official literature debut with the publication of Filippo Tommaso Marinetti's Manifesto of Futurism (1909). Futurist poetry is characterised by unexpected combinations of images and by its hyper-concision (in both economy of speech and actual length). Futurist theatre also played an important role within the movement and is distinguished by scenes that are only a few sentences long, an emphasis on nonsensical humour, and attempts to examine and subvert traditions of theatre via parody and other techniques. Longer forms of literature, such as the novel, have little place in the Futurist aesthetic of speed and compression, although there are exceptions like Marinetti's Mafarka the Futurist (1909) and Aldo Palazzeschi's Man of Smoke (1911).
Futurist literature primarily focuses on seven aspects: intuition, analogy, irony, abolition of syntax, metrical reform, onomatopoeia, and essential/synthetic lyricism. The ideals of the futurists expanded to their sculptures and painting styles as well; they were not fond of the cubism movement in France or the renaissance era progression (in their point of view, emasculation) and would often preach going back to old fashioned values in their manifestos and articles as well as their artwork. Although the movement was founded with manifestos written by men there were responses to Marinetti in particular from women whom considered themselves traditional feminists and did not see the previous renaissance movement as a shift towards emasculation, but relied too much on the traditional titles of ""men"" and ""women"" that pigeon holed society into believing they couldn't be empathetic and that a woman couldn't be vigorous.

Methodology
Intuition
In Marinetti's 1909 manifesto, Marinetti calls for the reawakening of ""divine intuition"" that ""after hours of relentless toil"" allows for the ""creative spirit seems suddenly to shake off its shackles and become prey to an incomprehensible spontaneity of conception and execution"".
Soffici had a more earthly reasoning. Intuition was the means by which creation took place. He believed that there could be no abstraction of the values of futurist literature in logical terms. Rather, art was a language in and of itself that could only be expressed in that language. Any attempt to extrapolate from the literature resulted ""in the evaluation not of artistic qualities but of extraneous matters"". As such, the spontaneous creation brought by intuition freed one from abstracting (and therefore adding erroneous material into the literature) and allowed on to speak in the language of art.
In this way, Futurists rallied against ""intellectualistic literature…[and] intelligible poetry"".  However, this idea is different from anti-intellectualism. They were not hostile to intellectual approaches, but just the specific intellectual approach that poetry had taken for so many years. Therefore, they often rejected any form of tradition as it had been tainted with the previous intellectual approaches of the past.

Analogy
Analogy's purpose in Futurist writing was to show that everything related to one another. They helped to unveil this true reality lying underneath the surface of existence. That is to say, despite what the experience might show one, everything is in fact interconnected. The more startling the comparison, the more successful it is.
The means for creating these analogies is intuition. This intuition is ""the poet's peculiar quality in that it enables him to discover analogies which, hidden to reason, are yet the essentials of art"". The discovering of analogies is made possible by intuition.
Marinetti believed that analogies had always existed, but earlier poets had not reached out enough to bring appropriately disparate entities together. By creating a communion of two (or more) seemingly unrelated objects, the poet pierces to the ""essence of reality"". The farther the poet has to reach in terms of logical remoteness is in direct proportion to its efficacy.
As analogy thus plays such an important role, it ""offers a touchstone to gauge poetical values…: the power to startle. The artistic criterion derived from analogy is stupefaction"". While an ordinary person's vision is colored by convention and tradition, the poet can brush away this top layer to reveal the reality below. The process of communicating the surprise is art while the ""stupefaction"" is the reaction to this discovery. Thus, analogies are the essence of poetry for the Futurists.

Irony
As the Futurists advocated the aforementioned intuition and the bucking of tradition, one might assume that they would suppress the use of irony. On the contrary, irony proved to be ""so old and forgotten that it looked almost new when the dust was brushed away from it. What was new and untried, at least more so than their principles and theories, wer",Literature,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurism_(literature),0,futurism modernist avantgarde movement literature part futurism art movement originated italy early th century made official literature debut publication filippo tommaso marinettis manifesto futurism futurist poetry characterised unexpected combination image hyperconcision economy speech actual length futurist theatre also played important role within movement distinguished scene sentence long emphasis nonsensical humour attempt examine subvert tradition theatre via parody technique longer form literature novel little place futurist aesthetic speed compression although exception like marinettis mafarka futurist aldo palazzeschis man smoke futurist literature primarily focus seven aspect intuition analogy irony abolition syntax metrical reform onomatopoeia essentialsynthetic lyricism ideal futurist expanded sculpture painting style well fond cubism movement france renaissance era progression point view emasculation would often preach going back old fashioned value manifesto article well artwork although movement founded manifesto written men response marinetti particular woman considered traditional feminist see previous renaissance movement shift towards emasculation relied much traditional title men woman pigeon holed society believing couldnt empathetic woman couldnt vigorous methodology intuition marinettis manifesto marinetti call reawakening divine intuition hour relentless toil allows creative spirit seems suddenly shake shackle become prey incomprehensible spontaneity conception execution soffici earthly reasoning intuition mean creation took place believed could abstraction value futurist literature logical term rather art language could expressed language attempt extrapolate literature resulted evaluation artistic quality extraneous matter spontaneous creation brought intuition freed one abstracting therefore adding erroneous material literature allowed speak language art way futurist rallied intellectualistic literature…and intelligible poetry however idea different antiintellectualism hostile intellectual approach specific intellectual approach poetry taken many year therefore often rejected form tradition tainted previous intellectual approach past analogy analogy purpose futurist writing show everything related one another helped unveil true reality lying underneath surface existence say despite experience might show one everything fact interconnected startling comparison successful mean creating analogy intuition intuition poet peculiar quality enables discover analogy hidden reason yet essential art discovering analogy made possible intuition marinetti believed analogy always existed earlier poet reached enough bring appropriately disparate entity together creating communion two seemingly unrelated object poet pierce essence reality farther poet reach term logical remoteness direct proportion efficacy analogy thus play important role offer touchstone gauge poetical values… power startle artistic criterion derived analogy stupefaction ordinary person vision colored convention tradition poet brush away top layer reveal reality process communicating surprise art stupefaction reaction discovery thus analogy essence poetry futurist irony futurist advocated aforementioned intuition bucking tradition one might assume would suppress use irony contrary irony proved old forgotten looked almost new dust brushed away new untried least principle theory wer
Ecodistrict,"An ecodistrict or eco-district (from ""ecological"" and ""district"") is a neighborhood, urban area, or region whose urban planning aims to integrate objectives of sustainable development and social equity, and to reduce the district's ecological footprint. The notion of an ""ecodistrict"" insists on the consideration of all environmental issues, via a collaborative process.
In order to design ecodistricts, one needs to completely redesign their energy system plans. The usage of photovoltaic panels and electric vehicles is common.

Examples
Ecodistricts can be found in metropolises such as :

Stockholm (Hammarby Sjöstad) (Sweden)
Hanover (Germany)
Marseille (Euroméditerranée) (France)
Bordeaux (Ginko) (France)
Freiburg im Breisgau (Vauban, Freiburg) (Germany)
Malmö (BO01) (Sweden)
London (BedZED) (United Kingdom)
Grenoble (De Bonne and Blanche Monier) (France)
Dongtan (China)
EVA Lanxmeer (Netherlands)
Amsterdam-Noord (Netherlands)
Jono district low-carbon project (Kitakyushu, Japan)
Frequel-Fontarabie (Paris, France)
Atlanta (Midtown, Atlanta Georgia) (United States)

Legal code (municipal),"A legal code is a body of law written by a local, non-sovereign government authority, such as a municipality. Whether authored or merely adopted by a municipality, it is typically, though not exclusively, enforced by the municipality, as the Authority Having Jurisdiction. A municipal code is usually a type of statutory instrument or delegated legislation.
A municipal legal code is similar in concept, though different in nature, to ""codes"" enacted by sovereign government authorities, such as a national government or a federal state or province within a federation.

Types of locally enforceable codes
Locally enforceable codes include but are not limited to:

Building code - enforced by building inspectors from the municipal building department
Fire code - enforced by the local fire prevention officers from the local fire department
Noise Control Code - enforced by municipal bylaw officers

Guideline codes
Some national and regional governments may issue model codes, such as a model building code. Examples include the National Building Code of Canada, the National Fire Code of Canada and Germany's MBO - Musterbauordnung. All three aforementioned examples are issued as guideline documents, which are then used by their Provinces and Bundesländer, respectively, as a baseline to author their own building codes, such as the Ontario Building Code (OBC) and fire codes, such as the Alberta Fire Code (AFC), respectively, which must then, in turn, also be adopted by the municipalities, before they become local law, which is then locally enforced by the municipalities. Usually, the municipality passes a by-law to adopt the code, so the same book applies across that whole territory or Province, etc.. Alternatively, a municipality may elect to issue its own version, such as The City of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, which typically makes its own changes to the British Columbia Building Code (BCBC), and then issues its own Vancouver Building By-law, rather than to simply adopt the BCBC, as all other municipalities in British Columbia do.

Code writing process
Typically, volunteers gather in committees at the location of the issuing authority to write and edit the code. Volunteers in both codes and standards writing are generally considered to be stakeholders. The governing body is generally intended to ensure that no one type of stakeholder dominates in order to be able to produce a more balanced and legally defensible final document. General principles of law and philosophy prevailing in the region may also have an influence.

Influencing factors upon code writing process
Example legal codes that rely heavily on precedent and the opinions of prior jurists include English common law and U.S. Constitutional Law.  By contrast most implementations of Islamic shariah. Napoleonic Code, Chinese law and German law, emphasize very specific philosophical principles rooted in Islam, French, Chinese, and German philosophy respectively – the role of precedent and prior jurists is much reduced and that of current judges enhanced – thus these can be seen as an ethical code which applies to the jurists themselves. In construction, precedents may include experience gained through fire losses and structural collapse. Lessons learned can be incorporated into revised codes or updates to prevent further losses.
If a legal system is not controlled by a single institution, the legal code typically includes ways to balance the power of different participants (sometimes known as checks and balances). These measures can reduce the potential for one group of participants to develop a monopoly over the legal system. For example, in a representative democracy, it may be required that elected officials make or vote on any changes to the law.
Apart from the foregoing, industry organisations tend to engage in attempts to influence the code writing process through participating in meetings of task committees and groups and providing evidence to make their cases. An example is the fire sprinkler lobby, which favours active fire protection, whereas members of the passive fire protection trades, for instance the International Firestop Council would argue the merits of its members' work. Stakeholders also include insurance companies, who stand to gain by keeping the operating risks of buildings low, whereas a real-estate developer may seek to keep costs low.

Purpose of a legal code
Generally, a legal code serves the dual purpose of broadcasting a certain idea of public morality as well as technical fact, and disclosing the retribution that the society, via the enforcing body, will visit on those who offend that morality. As an example, penalties are imposed for constructing an unsafe building or engaging in actions that will negatively impact the safety of a building. The severity of the punishment is intended to be commensurate with the severity of the offence.

Literary language,"Literary language is the register of a language used when writing in a formal, academic, or particularly polite tone; when speaking or writing in such a tone, it can also be known as formal language. It may be the standardized variety of a language. It can sometimes differ noticeably from the various spoken lects, but the difference between literary and non-literary forms is greater in some languages than in others. If there is a strong divergence between a written form and the spoken vernacular, the language is said to exhibit diglossia.
The understanding of the term differs from one linguistic tradition to another and is dependent on the terminological conventions adopted.

Literary English
For much of its history, there has been a distinction in the English language between an elevated literary language (written) and a colloquial or vernacular language (spoken, but sometimes also represented in writing). After the Norman conquest of England, for instance, Latin and French displaced English as the official and literary languages, and standardized literary English did not emerge until the end of the Middle Ages. At this time and into the Renaissance, the practice of aureation (the introduction of terms from classical languages, often through poetry) was an important part of the reclamation of status for the English language, and many historically aureate terms are now part of general common usage. Modern English no longer has quite the same distinction between literary and colloquial registers.
English has been used as a literary language in countries that were formerly part of the British Empire, for instance in India up to the present day, Malaysia in the early 20th century and Nigeria, where English remains the official language.
Written in Early Modern English, the King James Bible and works by William Shakespeare from the 17th century are defined as prototype mediums of literary English and are taught in advanced English classes. Furthermore, many literary words that are used today are found in abundance in the works of Shakespeare and as well as in King James Bible, hence the literary importance of early modern English in contemporary English literature and English studies.

Other languages
Arabic
Modern Standard Arabic is the contemporary literary and standard register of Classical Arabic used in writing across all Arabic-speaking countries and any governing body with Arabic as an official language. Many western scholars distinguish two varieties: the Classical Arabic of the Qur'an and early Islamic (7th to 9th centuries) literature; and Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), the standard language in use today. The modern standard language is closely based on the Classical language, and most Arabs consider the two varieties to be two registers of the same language. Literary Arabic or classical Arabic is the official language of all Arab countries and is the only form of Arabic taught in schools at all stages .
The sociolinguistic situation of Arabic in modern times provides a prime example of the linguistic phenomenon of diglossia—the use of two distinct varieties of the same language, usually in different social contexts. Educated Arabic speakers are usually able to communicate in MSA in formal situations. This diglossic situation facilitates code-switching in which a speaker switches back and forth between the two varieties of the language, sometimes even within the same sentence. In instances in which highly educated Arabic-speakers of different nationalities engage in conversation but find their dialects mutually unintelligible (e.g. a Moroccan speaking with a Kuwaiti), they are able to code switch into MSA for the sake of communication.

Aramaic
The Aramaic language has been diglossic for much of its history, with many different literary standards serving as the ""high"" liturgical languages, including Syriac language, Jewish Palestinian Aramaic, Jewish Babylonian Aramaic, Samaritan Aramaic language and Mandaic language, while the vernacular Neo-Aramaic languages serve as the vernacular language spoken by the common people like Northeastern Neo-Aramaic (Sureth, Bohtan Neo-Aramaic, Hértevin language, Koy Sanjaq Syriac language, Senaya language), Western Neo-Aramaic, Northeastern Neo-Aramaic, Central Neo-Aramaic (Mlahsô language, Turoyo language), Neo-Mandaic, Hulaulá language, Lishana Deni, Lishanid Noshan, Lishán Didán, Betanure Jewish Neo-Aramaic, and Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic.

Armenian
The Armenian language was a diglossic language for much of its history, with Classical Armenian serving as the ""high"" literary standard and liturgical language, and the Western Armenian and Eastern Armenian dialects serving as the vernacular language of the Armenian people. Western Armenian and Eastern Armenian were eventually standardized into their own literary forms.

Toy problem,"In scientific disciplines, a toy problem or a puzzlelike problem is a problem that is not of immediate scientific interest, yet is used as an expository device to illustrate a trait that may be shared by other, more complicated, instances of the problem, or as a way to explain a particular, more general, problem solving technique. A toy problem is useful to test and demonstrate methodologies. Researchers can use toy problems to compare the performance of different algorithms. They are also good for game designing.
For instance, while engineering a large system, the large problem is often broken down into many smaller toy problems which have been well understood in detail. Often these problems distill a few important aspects of complicated problems so that they can be studied in isolation. Toy problems are thus often very useful in providing intuition about specific phenomena in more complicated problems.
As an example, in the field of artificial intelligence, classical puzzles, games and problems are often used as toy problems. These include sliding-block puzzles, N-Queens problem, missionaries and cannibals problem, tic-tac-toe, chess, Tower of Hanoi and others.

Carryover effect,"The carryover effect is a term used in clinical chemistry to describe the transfer of unwanted material from one container or mixture to another. It describes the influence of one sample upon the following one. It may be from a specimen, or a reagent, or even the washing medium. The significance of carry over is that even a small amount can  lead to erroneous results.

Carryover effect in clinical laboratory
Carryover experiments are widely used for clinical chemistry and immunochemistry analyzers to evaluate and validate carryover effects.  The pipetting and washing systems in an automated analyzer are designed to continuously cycle between the aspiration of patient specimens and cleaning. An obvious concern is a potential for carryover of analyte from one patient specimen into one or more following patient specimens, which can falsely increase or decrease the measured analyte concentration. Specimen carryover is typically addressed by judicious choice of probe material, probe design, and an efficient probe washing system to flush the probe of residual patient specimens or reagents retained in their bores or clinging to the probe exterior surface before they are introduced into the next patient sample, reagent container, or cuvette/reaction vessel.

Significance in carryover assessment
The pathological range of measurement could be of several order to reference interval(e.g., Sex hormone, Tumor marker, Troponin...etc.).  A small portion of carryover could lead to erroneous results.

Carryover assessment

IUPAC made a recommendation in 1991 for the description and measurement of carryover effects in clinical chemistry.  The carryover ratio is the percentage of H3 carry to L1 constituting the carryover portion ""h"".  In a design of 3 high samples followed by 3 low samples, h can be calculated as (L1 - mean of L2&L3) / (H3 - mean of L2&L3)
The carryover ratio's acceptance criteria depend on the measurement and the laboratory concerned.  For example, 1% carryover of plasma albumin would generally lead to a clinically insignificant effect, while 1% carryover of cardiac High sensitivity Troponin assay would be catastrophic.

City region,"City region is a term used by urbanists, economists and urban planners to refer to how one or more core cities are linked to a hinterland by functional ties, such as economic, housing-market, commuting, marketing or retail catchment factors. This concept emphasizes the importance of these functional relationships in understanding urban areas and their surrounding regions, often providing more insightful perspectives than the arbitrary boundaries assigned to administrative bodies.

Global perspective
Using Geographic information system (GIS) technology, city-regions have been mapped globally, revealing significant interconnectedness among urban centers and their surrounding areas. The Nature Cities article “Worldwide Delineation of Multi-Tier City–Regions” classified over 30,000 urban centers into four tiers—town, small, intermediate, and large city—based on population size and mapped their catchment areas based on travel time rather than administrative boundaries. Travel time is used to reflect daily commuting patterns within a 1-hour limit and less frequent activities up to a 3-hour limit. This publicly available dataset shows that 3.2 billion people have physical access to multiple tiers within an hour, and 4.7 billion within three hours. It also distinguishes between primary and secondary city-regions; in secondary ones, catchment areas of urban centers overlap with those of larger centers. This approach highlights how people rely on multiple urban centers for different needs, with larger centers offering a wider range of activities. For example, a person might shop in a nearby town, work in an intermediate city, and use an airport in a large city, thus belonging to the catchment areas of several urban centers. The City–Regions System Toolbox (CREST) allows to check out any country's distribution in population access to cities of different sizes based on travel time.

United Kingdom
In the United Kingdom, the city regional agenda began to be seen as an alternative to the regional assemblies in England that were favoured as a partial answer to the West Lothian question but rejected in a referendum by voters in North East England in November 2004.  The concept of city regions and their development features heavily in The Northern Way, a collaborative development plan between the three northernmost English regional development agencies.  An embryonic city regional framework exists in the form of the Passenger Transport Executive and the Core Cities Group.   The October 2006 Local Government White Paper did not contain firm proposals for city-region-wide authorities however.
The New Local Government Network proposed the creation of city regions as part of on-going reform efforts, while a report released by the IPPR's Centre for Cities proposed the creation of four large city-regions based on Birmingham, Leeds, Liverpool and Greater Manchester. The strong economy of Edinburgh and its hinterland (Forth Valley, Fife, West Lothian, Midlothian and East Lothian) means it has been named as one of Europe's fasting growing city-regions.
Also in 2006, the OECD published a number of studies on city regions, including an assessment profile of the Newcastle-Gateshead city region and a review of numerous city regions across the world.
In July 2007, HM Treasury published its Review of sub-national economic development and regeneration, which stated that the government would allow those city regions that wished to work together to form a statutory framework for city regional activity, including powers over transport, skills, planning and economic development.  Under the government's Transport Innovation Fund, city regions can band together to pilot forms of road pricing, such as the Greater Manchester congestion charge considered by councils in Greater Manchester (but later rejected by referendum).  In the April 2009 Budget, the government announced that Greater Manchester and Leeds would be the first two city regions with formal powers.  While this was later discontinued as a result of the May 2010 general election, the  Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition government did agree to the creation of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority in 2011, with all other proposals and the regional development agencies being subsumed into the local enterprise partnerships.

France
Since January 2010 municipalities, departments and cities can combine into a larger body known as a Metropole. The first Metropole in France, Nice-Cote-d'Azur was created in 2011. In 2014 the government of Jean-Marc Ayrault passed a bill that moved away from the voluntary nature and made it mandatory for all Metropolitan areas of over 600,000 inhabitants to become Metropoles as of January 1, 2015. The first 3 mandatory Metropoles are;

Marl lake,"A marl lake is a type of alkaline lake whose bottom sediments include large deposits of marl, a mixture of clay and carbonate minerals. The term is particularly applied to lakes that have been dredged or mined for marl, often for manufacturing Portland cement.
Marl lakes are found around the Great Lakes of North America, in Britain, and in other areas that were once glaciated. They support distinctive ecological communities that are vulnerable to damage from silting, nutrient pollution, drainage, and invasive species.

Description
Marl lakes typically are found in areas that were recently glaciated, and they often fill kettle depressions left behind by melting glaciers. Their most distinctive characteristic is that they deposit sediments rich in calcium carbonate. More precisely, a marl lake is a lake in which calcium carbonate makes up at least 50% of the dry weight of the inorganic fraction of the surface sediments. In some lakes, the sediments are almost pure calcium carbonate.
The calcium carbonate precipitates from lake water that is alkaline, typically with a pH 8.0 or greater, and has a high concentration of divalent ions and is low in dissolved organic compounds. The concentration of calcium carbonate in the lake water usually exceeds 100 mg per liter. Young marl lakes are sometimes visually stunning, with very fine suspended crystals of calcium carbonate giving the water an opaque light blue color.
In Britain, marl lakes are of glacial origin and are shallow (less than 4 meters or 13 feet deep). They are associated with carbonate bedrock or bedrock of the Old Red Sandstone. Their concentration of calcium carbonate is 140 mg/L, typical of temperate limestone groundwater.
The precipitation of calcium carbonate from marl lakes is a consequence of removal of carbon dioxide by photosynthesis (particularly by Chara, stonewort, which becomes encrusted with low-magnesium calcite during the summer) or outgassing of saturated groundwater, or as a result of the common-ion effect.
Higgins Lake, in central Michigan, US, is the only known location of freshwater oolites. These are found in a narrow band between a beach rich in clastic sediments and deeper water below wave base.

Ecology
Marl lakes of the upper Great Lakes region have a very low biological productivity. They typically are very sparse in macrophytes (macroscopic plants and algae), and their productivity is dominated by one macrophyte species, Scirpus subterminalis (water bulrush), which is responsible for an average of 79% of the total biomass. Chara (stonewort) accounts for 12% of the biomass but limited to the most shallow, protected parts of the lake. Potamogeton (pondweed) provides most of the remaining biomass.
Marl lakes often contain lakemounts. These are thought to  begin with thin patches in the original kettle ice, which were colonized by Najas, Potamogeton, and Chara. These locally enhanced the sediment deposition rate to build up the lakemounts to near the lake surface. The lakes are often surrounded by beachrock composed of cemented pisoliths (calcite concretions) and gastropod shells. The shallow beachrock slopes are inhabited by Chara.
British marl lakes are dominated by Chara, which is the source of the marl. By contrast with marl lakes of the Great Lakes region, they have a rich emergent and submerged macrophyte community. They are also home to many gastropods and crustaceans.
Iron is a limiting nutrient in marl lakes, as it is practically insoluble in oxygenated, alkaline water. To be available at all, it must be chelated by organic matter. But because the primary productivity is low, organic matter is scarce; this means there is little chelation of iron, which keeps primary productivity low in a vicious cycle. Phosphate, another essential nutrient, is precipitated along with carbonates, further reducing the supply of nutrients.
Some mare lakes are meromictic lakes in which bottom water never mixes with surface water. Green Lake, at Fayetteville, New York, is a meromictic marl lake containing a cyanobacterial thrombolitic bioherm.
Marl lakes are ecologically important, but are vulnerable to damage by silting, nutrient pollution, drainage, and invasive species. To some extent, the high calcium content of marl lake water buffers it against phosphate, but the native ecological community is sensitive even to small changes in chemistry and the introduction of nutrient pollution renders the lake more hospitable to invasive species. Eventually a threshold is reached at which the lake rapidly loses its marl characteristics and flowering plants replace Chara. In Britain, only the marl lakes of the more remote parts of northern Scotland are likely to remain pristine into the near future. Many are transient or eutrophic, and at least half those in Britain have been affected by nutrient pollution.

As records of climate changes
Marl ponds steadily deposit sediments that can be dated by carbon-14. They also contain proxies for local climate.

Discharge regime,"Discharge regime, flow regime, or hydrological regime (commonly termed river regime, but that term is also used for other measurements) is the long-term pattern of annual changes to a stream's discharge at a particular point. Hence, it shows how the discharge of a stream at that point is expected to change over the year. It is thus the hydrological equivalent of climate. The main factor affecting the regime is climate, along with relief, bedrock, soil and vegetation, as well as human activity.
Like general trends can be grouped together into certain named groups, either by what causes them and the part of the year they happen (most classifications) or by the climate in which they most commonly appear (Beckinsale classification). There are many different classifications; however, most of them are localized to a specific area and cannot be used to classify all the rivers of the world.
When interpreting such records of discharge, it is important to factor in the timescale over which the average monthly values were calculated. It is particularly difficult to establish a typical annual discharge regime for rivers with high interannual variability in monthly discharge and/or significant changes in the catchment's characteristics (e.g. tectonic influences or the introduction of water management practices).

Overview
Maurice Pardé was the first to classify river regimes more thoroughly. His classification was based on what the primary reasons for such pattern are, and how many of them there are. According to this, he termed three basic types:

Simple regimes, where there is only one dominant factor.
Mixed or double regimes, where there are two dominant factors.
Complex regimes, where there are multiple dominant factors.
Pardé split the simple regimes further into temperature-dependent (glacial, mountains snow melt, plains snow melt; latter two often called ""nival"") and rainfall-dependent or pluvial (equatorial, intertropical, temperate oceanic, mediterranean) categories.
Beckinsale later more clearly defined the distinct simple regimes based on climate present in the catchment area and thus splitting the world into ""hydrological regions"". His main inspiration was the Köppen climate classification, and he also devised strings of letters to define them. However, the system was criticised as it based the regimes on climate instead of purely on discharge pattern and also lacked some patterns.
Another attempt to provide classification of world regimes was made in 1988 by Heines et al., which was based purely on the discharge pattern and classified all patterns into one of 15 categories; however, the determination is sometimes contradictory and quite complex, and the distinction does not differentiate between simple, mixed or complex regimes as it determines the regime solely on the main peak, which is contradictory to commonly used system in the Alpine region. Hence, rivers with nivo-pluvial regimes are commonly split into two different categories, while most pluvio-nival regimes are all grouped into a single category along with complex regimes – the uniform regime, despite showing quite pronounced and regular yearly pattern. Moreover, it does not differentiate between temperature-dependant and rainfall-dependant regimes. Nonetheless, it added one new regime that was not present in Beckinsale's classification, the moderate mid-autumn regime with a peak in November (Northern Hemisphere) or May (Southern Hemisphere). This system too, is very rarely used.

In later years, most of the research was only done in the region around the Alps, so that area is much more thoroughly researched than others, and most names for subclasses of regimes are for those found there. These were mostly further differentiated from Pardé's distinction. The most common names given, although they might be defined differently in different publications, are:

Glacial, for regimes where most of water is due to melting of snow and ice and the peak occurs in late summer.
Nival, with a peak in late spring or early summer and still high importance of snow-melt.
Pluvial, which is (almost) purely based on seasonal rainfall and not on snow. A peak is usually in winter, although it can occur at any point along the year. If it occurs in the time of monsoons, it is sometimes called tropical pluvial.
Nivo-pluvial, with a nival peak in late spring and a pluvial peak in the fall. The main minimum is in winter.
Pluvio-nival, which is similar to nivo-pluvial, but the nival peak is earlier (March/April on the Northern Hemisphere) and the main minimum is in summer, not in winter.
Nivo-glacial, for regimes sharing characteristics of glacial and nival regimes and a peak in mid summer.
The Pardé's differentiation of single regimes from mixed regimes is sometimes rather considered to be based on the number of peaks rather than the number of factors as it is more objective. Most of nival and even glacial regimes have some influence of rainfall and regimes considered pluvia",Rivers,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discharge_regime,1,discharge regime flow regime hydrological regime commonly termed river regime term also used measurement longterm pattern annual change stream discharge particular point hence show discharge stream point expected change year thus hydrological equivalent climate main factor affecting regime climate along relief bedrock soil vegetation well human activity like general trend grouped together certain named group either cause part year happen classification climate commonly appear beckinsale classification many different classification however localized specific area used classify river world interpreting record discharge important factor timescale average monthly value calculated particularly difficult establish typical annual discharge regime river high interannual variability monthly discharge andor significant change catchment characteristic eg tectonic influence introduction water management practice overview maurice pardé first classify river regime thoroughly classification based primary reason pattern many according termed three basic type simple regime one dominant factor mixed double regime two dominant factor complex regime multiple dominant factor pardé split simple regime temperaturedependent glacial mountain snow melt plain snow melt latter two often called nival rainfalldependent pluvial equatorial intertropical temperate oceanic mediterranean category beckinsale later clearly defined distinct simple regime based climate present catchment area thus splitting world hydrological region main inspiration köppen climate classification also devised string letter define however system criticised based regime climate instead purely discharge pattern also lacked pattern another attempt provide classification world regime made heines et al based purely discharge pattern classified pattern one category however determination sometimes contradictory quite complex distinction differentiate simple mixed complex regime determines regime solely main peak contradictory commonly used system alpine region hence river nivopluvial regime commonly split two different category pluvionival regime grouped single category along complex regime – uniform regime despite showing quite pronounced regular yearly pattern moreover differentiate temperaturedependant rainfalldependant regime nonetheless added one new regime present beckinsales classification moderate midautumn regime peak november northern hemisphere may southern hemisphere system rarely used later year research done region around alp area much thoroughly researched others name subclass regime found mostly differentiated pardés distinction common name given although might defined differently different publication glacial regime water due melting snow ice peak occurs late summer nival peak late spring early summer still high importance snowmelt pluvial almost purely based seasonal rainfall snow peak usually winter although occur point along year occurs time monsoon sometimes called tropical pluvial nivopluvial nival peak late spring pluvial peak fall main minimum winter pluvionival similar nivopluvial nival peak earlier marchapril northern hemisphere main minimum summer winter nivoglacial regime sharing characteristic glacial nival regime peak mid summer pardés differentiation single regime mixed regime sometimes rather considered based number peak rather number factor objective nival even glacial regime influence rainfall regime considered pluvia
Americas,"The Americas, sometimes collectively called America, are a landmass comprising the totality of North America and South America. When viewed as a single continent, the Americas or America is the 2nd largest continent by area after Asia, and is the 3rd largest continent by population. The Americas make up most of the land in Earth's Western Hemisphere and comprise the New World.
Along with their associated islands, the Americas cover 8% of Earth's total surface area and 28.4% of its land area. The topography is dominated by the American Cordillera, a long chain of mountains that runs the length of the west coast. The flatter eastern side of the Americas is dominated by large river basins, such as the Amazon, St. Lawrence River–Great Lakes, Mississippi, and La Plata basins. Since the Americas extend 14,000 km (8,700 mi) from north to south, the climate and ecology vary widely, from the arctic tundra of Northern Canada, Greenland, and Alaska, to the tropical rainforests in Central America and South America.
Humans first settled the Americas from Asia between 20,000 and 16,000 years ago. A second migration of Na-Dene speakers followed later from Asia. The subsequent migration of the Inuit into the neoarctic c. 3500 BCE completed what is generally regarded as the settlement by the Indigenous peoples of the Americas. The first known European settlement in the Americas was by the Norse explorer Leif Erikson. However, the colonization never became permanent and was later abandoned. The Spanish voyages of Christopher Columbus from 1492 to 1504 resulted in permanent contact with European (and subsequently, other Old World) powers, which eventually led to the Columbian exchange and inaugurated a period of exploration, conquest, and colonization whose effects and consequences persist to the present.
The Spanish presence involved the enslavement of large numbers of the indigenous population of America. Diseases introduced from Europe and West Africa devastated the indigenous peoples, and the European powers colonized the Americas. Mass emigration from Europe, including large numbers of indentured servants, and importation of African slaves largely replaced the indigenous peoples in much of the Americas. Decolonization of the Americas began with the American Revolution in the 1770s and largely ended with the Spanish–American War in the late 1890s. Currently, almost all of the population of the Americas resides in independent countries; however, the legacy of the colonization and settlement by Europeans is that the Americas share many common cultural traits, most notably Christianity and the use of West European languages: primarily Spanish, English, Portuguese, French, and, to a lesser extent, Dutch.
The Americas are home to more than a billion inhabitants, two-thirds of whom reside in the United States, Brazil, and Mexico. It is home to eight megacities (metropolitan areas with 10 million inhabitants or more): Greater Mexico City (21.2 million), São Paulo (21.2 million), New York City (19.7 million), Los Angeles (18.8 million), Buenos Aires (15.6 million), Rio de Janeiro (13.0 million), Bogotá (10.4 million), and Lima (10.1 million).

Etymology and naming
The name ""America"" was first recorded in 1507. A two-dimensional globe created by Martin Waldseemüller was the earliest recorded use of the term. The name was also used (together with the related term Amerigen) in the Cosmographiae Introductio, apparently written by Matthias Ringmann, in reference to South America. It was applied to both North and South America by Gerardus Mercator in 1538. ""America"" derives from Americus, the Latin version of Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci's first name. 
The feminine form America was originally used to refer to the newly discovered continent, which is why it was accorded with the feminine names of the other continents: Asia, Africa, and Europa.
Since the 1950s, however, North America and South America have generally been considered by English speakers as separate continents, and taken together are called the Americas, or more rarely America. When conceived as a unitary continent, the form is generally the continent of America in the singular. However, without a clarifying context, singular America in English commonly refers to the United States of America.

Terminology
History
The region was initially termed America or New India on the Mercator maps.

English
Speakers of English generally refer to the landmasses of North America and South America as the Americas, the Western Hemisphere, or the New World. The adjective American may be used to indicate something pertaining to the Americas, but this term is primarily used in English to indicate something pertaining to the United States. Some non-ambiguous alternatives exist, such as the adjective Pan-American, or New Worlder as a demonym for a resident of the closely related New World. Use of America in the hemispherical sense is sometimes retained, or can occur when translated from ot",Continents,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas,1,america sometimes collectively called america landmass comprising totality north america south america viewed single continent america america nd largest continent area asia rd largest continent population america make land earth western hemisphere comprise new world along associated island america cover earth total surface area land area topography dominated american cordillera long chain mountain run length west coast flatter eastern side america dominated large river basin amazon st lawrence river–great lake mississippi la plata basin since america extend km mi north south climate ecology vary widely arctic tundra northern canada greenland alaska tropical rainforest central america south america human first settled america asia year ago second migration nadene speaker followed later asia subsequent migration inuit neoarctic c bce completed generally regarded settlement indigenous people america first known european settlement america norse explorer leif erikson however colonization never became permanent later abandoned spanish voyage christopher columbus resulted permanent contact european subsequently old world power eventually led columbian exchange inaugurated period exploration conquest colonization whose effect consequence persist present spanish presence involved enslavement large number indigenous population america disease introduced europe west africa devastated indigenous people european power colonized america mass emigration europe including large number indentured servant importation african slave largely replaced indigenous people much america decolonization america began american revolution largely ended spanish–american war late currently almost population america resides independent country however legacy colonization settlement european america share many common cultural trait notably christianity use west european language primarily spanish english portuguese french lesser extent dutch america home billion inhabitant twothirds reside united state brazil mexico home eight megacities metropolitan area million inhabitant greater mexico city million são paulo million new york city million los angeles million buenos aire million rio de janeiro million bogotá million lima million etymology naming name america first recorded twodimensional globe created martin waldseemüller earliest recorded use term name also used together related term amerigen cosmographiae introductio apparently written matthias ringmann reference south america applied north south america gerardus mercator america derives americus latin version italian explorer amerigo vespucci first name feminine form america originally used refer newly discovered continent accorded feminine name continent asia africa europa since however north america south america generally considered english speaker separate continent taken together called america rarely america conceived unitary continent form generally continent america singular however without clarifying context singular america english commonly refers united state america terminology history region initially termed america new india mercator map english speaker english generally refer landmass north america south america america western hemisphere new world adjective american may used indicate something pertaining america term primarily used english indicate something pertaining united state nonambiguous alternative exist adjective panamerican new worlder demonym resident closely related new world use america hemispherical sense sometimes retained occur translated ot

Africa,"Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most populous continent after Asia. At about 30.3 million km2 (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 20% of Earth's land area and 6% of its total surface area. With nearly 1.4 billion people as of 2021, it accounts for about 18% of the world's human population. Africa's population is the youngest among all the continents; the median age in 2012 was 19.7, when the worldwide median age was 30.4. Based on 2024 projections, Africa's population will exceed 3.8 billion people by 2100. Africa is the least wealthy inhabited continent per capita and second-least wealthy by total wealth, ahead of Oceania. Scholars have attributed this to different factors including geography, climate, corruption, colonialism, the Cold War, and neocolonialism. Despite this low concentration of wealth, recent economic expansion and a large and young population make Africa an important economic market in the broader global context, and Africa has a large quantity of natural resources.
Africa straddles the equator and the prime meridian. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, the Arabian Plate and the Gulf of Aqaba to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. France, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and Yemen have parts of their territories located on African geographical soil, mostly in the form of islands.
The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognised sovereign states, eight cities and islands that are part of non-African states, and two de facto independent states with limited or no recognition. This count does not include Malta and Sicily, which are geologically part of the African continent. Algeria is Africa's largest country by area, and Nigeria is its largest by population. African nations cooperate through the establishment of the African Union, which is headquartered in Addis Ababa.
Africa is highly biodiverse; it is the continent with the largest number of megafauna species, as it was least affected by the extinction of the Pleistocene megafauna. However, Africa is also heavily affected by a wide range of environmental issues, including desertification, deforestation, water scarcity, and pollution. These entrenched environmental concerns are expected to worsen as climate change impacts Africa. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has identified Africa as the continent most vulnerable to climate change.
The history of Africa is long, complex, and varied, and has often been under-appreciated by the global historical community. In African societies the oral word is revered, and they have generally recorded their history via oral tradition, which has led anthropologists to term them ""oral civilisations"", contrasted with ""literate civilisations"" which pride the written word.: 142–143  African culture is rich and diverse both within and between the continent's regions, encompassing art, cuisine, music and dance, religion, and dress.  
Africa, particularly Eastern Africa, is widely accepted to be the place of origin of humans and the Hominidae clade, also known as the great apes. The earliest hominids and their ancestors have been dated to around 7 million years ago, and Homo sapiens (modern human) are believed to have originated in Africa 350,000 to 260,000 years ago. In the 4th and 3rd millennia BCE Ancient Egypt, Kerma, Punt, and the Tichitt Tradition emerged in North, East and West Africa, while from 3000 BCE to 500 CE the Bantu expansion swept from modern-day Cameroon through Central, East, and Southern Africa, displacing or absorbing groups such as the Khoisan and Pygmies. Some African empires include Wagadu, Mali, Songhai, Sokoto, Ife, Benin, Asante, the Fatimids, Almoravids, Almohads, Ayyubids, Mamluks, Kongo, Mwene Muji, Luba, Lunda, Kitara, Aksum, Ethiopia, Adal, Ajuran, Kilwa, Sakalava, Imerina, Maravi, Mutapa, Rozvi, Mthwakazi, and Zulu. Despite the predominance of states, many societies were heterarchical and stateless. Slave trades created various diasporas, especially in the Americas. From the late 19th century to early 20th century, driven by the Second Industrial Revolution, most of Africa was rapidly conquered and colonised by European nations, save for Ethiopia and Liberia. European rule had significant impacts on Africa's societies, and colonies were maintained for the purpose of economic exploitation and extraction of natural resources. Most present states emerged from a process of decolonisation following World War II, and established the Organisation of African Unity in 1963, the predecessor to the African Union. The nascent countries decided to keep their colonial borders, with traditional power structures used in governance to varying degrees.

Hobohemia,"Hobohemia is a low-rent district in a city where artistic bohemians and the down-and-outs or hobos mix. In Chicago from the turn of the century to circa 1940s this was Tower Town and the area often known as ""The West Madison Stem"" (Madison Street west of downtown) which was known as ""Skid road"" and home to thousands of transient men and women, and Ben Reitman's Hobo College. In New York City it was the neighborhood of the Bowery,   and Greenwich Village. It was the title of a short story by Sinclair Lewis originally published in The Saturday Evening Post, which Lewis subsequently reworked into a three-act comedy which was first performed at the Greenwich Village Theatre in 1919.
A reference appears in the Rodgers and Hart song The Lady is a Tramp: ""My Hobohemia is the place to be.""

Toponymy of the Kerguelen Islands,"The Kerguelen Islands, an archipelago in the southern Indian Ocean, were discovered uninhabited on February 12, 1772 by Breton navigator Yves Joseph de Kerguelen de Trémarec, and have remained without a permanent population ever since. The only residents were during an attempt to set up a farm, a few occasional occupations for whaling activities, and since the 1950s, a French scientific presence. Its toponymy was thus given, starting from a blank page, by the various explorers, whalers and sealers who frequented its waters and anchorages, and then in the 20th century, once French possession of the archipelago had been reaffirmed, by a few French institutions.
According to historian Gracie Delépine, the place names of the Kerguelen Islands are ""witnesses both to the gradual discovery made by Europeans, and to the intellectual civilization of those same Europeans. Over a thousand toponyms have been left on the archipelago by explorers, hunters, fishermen, scientists and navies from all over the world, from the time of its discovery in 1772 to the present day. In addition, they give a geographical portrait of the islands, as well as a zoological and botanical description: they make up their natural history.’’

Toponymy by Yves Joseph de Kerguelen de Trémarec – 1772 and 1773
The first toponymy of the archipelago, the names given by Yves Joseph de Kerguelen have almost all survived to the present day. This toponymy mainly derives from the names of the expedition's ships and officers, the navigator's native Brittany, the royal family, Kerguelen's patrons and ministers. For the latter, it's worth noting the political aspect of toponymy. While the first toponyms were drawn up by ministers in the court of Louis XV, the second expedition, after which Kerguelen sought rehabilitation, saw the names of new ministers in the court of Louis XVI appear. During these two expeditions, the island having been little explored, the coastal topography and remarkable points visible from the sea were named.
Here are a few examples:

Pic Saint-Allouarn, named after Louis Aleno de Saint-Aloüarn, commander of the Gros Ventre, the expedition's second ship,
Baie d'Audierne, after the Bay of Audierne in Brittany
Golfe Choiseul, after Étienne-François de Choiseul, minister of Louis XV
Île du Roland, from the Rolland, ship of the second expedition
Îles de Boynes, named after the Marquis de Boynes, French Secretary of State for the Navy.
Pointe Tromelin, named after the Chevalier de Tromelin, then Port-Louis port administrator.

Toponymy of James Cook – 1776
During his 1776 voyage, navigator James Cook sailed along the north, east, and southeast coasts of the archipelago, confirming its insularity. He commissioned his lieutenant, William Bligh, the future captain of HMS Bounty, to produce a map of the islands. The map gave some twenty toponyms to points or places visible from the sea. The most important of these is the name of the archipelago itself: îles de la Désolation, or terre de Kerguelen. The former name was used for over a century by American and British whalers and sealers, before falling into disuse; the latter was used by naval and scientific missions and became the sole name at the beginning of the 20th century.
Other toponyms given by Cook refer to members of the British royal family, British ministers of the time, scientists under his protection or some of his officers. There are also a few descriptive toponyms:

Port-Christmas (Christmas Harbour), where Kerguelen docked and sheltered on his arrival in Kerguelen on Christmas Day 1776. Initially, the name had been given to what Kerguelen had named Baie de l'Oiseau (harbour ). But the name became so popular that it was subsequently retained in official toponymy, but only to refer to the site at the head of the bay.
The Prince of Wales Peninsula, after the young Prince of Wales George Augustus of Hanover, the future George IV.
Île Howe, after Lord Howe, then commander of the British armies in North America.
Mont Campbell (north of the Courbet Peninsula), after Vice-Admiral John Campbell (and not George Campbell, lieutenant on the HMS Challenger during the 1879 expedition, as was thought for a while).
Pointe Pringle (east of Loranchet Peninsula), named after the Scotsman Sir John Pringle, president of the Royal Society and a friend of Cook's.
Pointe de l'Arche (now collapsed), north of the Loranchet Peninsula.
Îles Nuageuses
Passe Royale: Cook originally named the whole of what is now the Gulf of Morbihan Royal Sound, but the name remains today only for the pass that gives access to it. It is framed by Cape George (named after King George III) and Point Charlotte (named after his wife, Queen Charlotte).
Baie blanche, the bay being ""because of certain white areas of earth or rocks in the bottom of it"",

Figura serpentinata,"Figura serpentinata (lit. 'serpentine figure') is a style in painting and sculpture, intended to make the figure seem more dynamic, that is typical of Mannerism. It is similar, but not identical, to contrapposto, and features figures often in a spiral pose. Early examples can be seen in the work of Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael and Michelangelo.
Emil Maurer writes of the painter and theorist Gian Paolo Lomazzo (1538–1600): ""The recommended ideal form unites, after Lomazzo, three qualities: the pyramid, the serpentinata movement and a certain numerical proportion, all three united to form one whole. At the same time, precedence is given to the ""moto"", that is, to the meandering movement, which should make the pyramid, in exact proportion, into the geometrical form of a cone.""

Bousquet holds that the serpentinata style arose as a result of the discovery of the Laocoön group in 1506, and its deep impact on all artists, but on Michelangelo in particular. John Shearman also argues that it was invented by Michelangelo, citing the ""Victors"" that he produced for Pope Julius II's tomb. Maurer, on the other hand, can only detect this style rarely in Michelangelo's work and cites Beccafumi instead as its pioneer. Beccafumi's student Marco Pino connected Beccafumi's style with those of Salviati, Parmigianino and perhaps even Michelangelo, and his work as a whole is marked by serpentinata motifs. Paolo Pino himself says in his Dialogo della Pittura, that his figures' poses are many and varied, and that in all his works to find one single figure, that completely and utterly distorts, is ambivalent and difficult.
As Maurer writes, painters are freer than sculptors and less closely tied-down to nature. Thus, they can play around with their figures, reshaping, overstretching, geometricising, dissolving, caricaturing, colouring, or meandering according to the painting's goal and intended effect. With the loosening of the norms of the Renaissance art and the development of the ""serpentita"" style, that style's structures and rules began to be systematised. A style of form began by which figures showed physical power, passion, tension and semantic perfection. Movements were not without motivation, nor even simply done with a will, but with will shown in a pure form . Also their actions arose not out of power, but powerlessness.
The style exerted an influence even into the 1620s, with Bernini's The Rape of Proserpina.

Atmospheric chemistry,"Atmospheric chemistry is a branch of atmospheric science that studies the chemistry of the Earth's atmosphere and that of other planets. This multidisciplinary approach of research draws on environmental chemistry, physics, meteorology, computer modeling, oceanography, geology and volcanology, climatology and other disciplines to understand both natural and human-induced changes in atmospheric composition. Key areas of research include the behavior of trace gasses, the formation of pollutants, and the role of aerosols and greenhouse gasses. Through a combination of observations, laboratory experiments, and computer modeling, atmospheric chemists investigate the causes and consequences of atmospheric changes.

Atmospheric composition
The composition and chemistry of the Earth's atmosphere is important for several reasons, but primarily because of the interactions between the atmosphere and living organisms. Natural processes such as volcano emissions, lightning and bombardment by solar particles from corona changes the composition of the Earth's atmosphere. It has also been changed by human activity and some of these changes are harmful to human health, crops and ecosystems.

Trace gas composition
Besides the major components listed above, the Earth's atmosphere contains many trace gas species that vary significantly depending on nearby sources and sinks. These trace gasses include compounds such as CFCs/HCFCs which are particularly damaging to the ozone layer, and H2S which has a characteristic foul odor of rotten eggs and can be smelt in concentrations as low as 0.47 ppb. Some approximate amounts near the surface of some additional gasses are listed below. In addition to gasses, the atmosphere contains particles such as aerosol, which includes examples such as droplets, ice crystals, bacteria, and dust.

History
The first scientific studies of atmospheric composition began in the 18th century when chemists such as Joseph Priestley, Antoine Lavoisier and Henry Cavendish made the first measurements of the composition of the atmosphere.
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, researchers shifted their interest towards trace constituents with very low concentrations. An important finding from this era was the discovery of ozone by Christian Friedrich Schönbein in 1840.
In the 20th century atmospheric science moved from studying the composition of air to consider how the concentrations of trace gasses in the atmosphere have changed over time and the chemical processes which create and destroy compounds in the air. Two important outcomes were the explanation by Sydney Chapman and Gordon Dobson of how the ozone layer is created and maintained, and Arie Jan Haagen-Smit’s explanation of photochemical smog. Further studies on ozone issues led to the 1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry award shared between Paul Crutzen, Mario Molina and Frank Sherwood Rowland. 

In the 21st century the focus is now shifting again. Instead of concentrating on atmospheric chemistry in isolation, it is now seen as one part of the Earth system with the rest of the atmosphere, biosphere and geosphere. A driving force for this link is the relationship between chemistry and climate. The changing climate and the recovery of the ozone hole and the interaction of the composition of the atmosphere with the oceans and terrestrial ecosystems are examples of the interdependent relationships between Earth's systems. A new field of extraterrestrial atmospheric chemistry has also recently emerged. Astrochemists analyze the atmospheric compositions of the Solar System and exoplanets to determine the formation of astronomical objects and find habitual conditions for Earth-like life.

Methodology
Observations, lab measurements, and modeling are the three central elements in atmospheric chemistry. Progress in atmospheric chemistry is often driven by the interactions between these components and they form an integrated whole. For example, observations may tell us that more of a chemical compound exists than previously thought possible. This will stimulate new modeling and laboratory studies which will increase our scientific understanding to a level where we can explain the observations.

Observation
Field observations of chemical systems are essential to understanding atmospheric processes and determining the accuracy of models. Atmospheric chemistry measurements are long term to observe continuous trends or short term to observe smaller variations. In situ and remote measurements can be made using observatories, satellites, field stations, and laboratories. 
Routine observations of chemical composition show changes in atmospheric composition over time. Observatories such as the Mauna Loa and mobile platforms such as aircraft ships and balloons (e.g. the UK's Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements) study chemical compositions and weather dynamics.

Drainage divide,"A drainage divide, water divide, ridgeline, watershed, water parting or height of land is elevated terrain that separates neighboring drainage basins. On rugged land, the divide lies along topographical ridges, and may be in the form of a single range of hills or mountains, known as a dividing range. On flat terrain, especially where the ground is marshy, the divide may be difficult to discern.
A triple divide is a point, often a summit, where three drainage basins meet. A valley floor divide is a low drainage divide that runs across a valley, sometimes created by deposition or stream capture. Major divides separating rivers that drain to different seas or oceans are continental divides.
The term height of land is used in Canada and the United States to refer to a drainage divide. It is frequently used in border descriptions, which are set according to the ""doctrine of natural boundaries"". In glaciated areas it often refers to a low point on a divide where it is possible to portage a canoe from one river system to another.

Types
Drainage divides can be divided into three types:

Continental divides in which waters on each side flow to different oceans, such as the Continental Divide of the Americas and the Congo-Nile Divide.
Major drainage divides in which waters on each side of the divide never meet but flow into the same ocean, such as the divide between the Yellow River basin and the Yangtze. Another, more subtle example is the Schuylkill-Lehigh divide at Pisgah Mountain in Pennsylvania in which two minor creeks divide to flow and grow east and west respectively joining the Lehigh River and Delaware River or the Susquehanna River and Potomac River, with each tributary complex having separate outlets into the Atlantic.
Minor drainage divides in which waters are originally separate but eventually join at a river confluence, such as the Mississippi River and the Missouri River drainage divides.

Valley-floor divides
A valley-floor divide occurs on the bottom of a valley and arises as a result of subsequent depositions, such as scree, in a valley through which a river originally flowed continuously.
Examples include the Kartitsch Saddle in the Gail valley in East Tyrol, which forms the watershed between the Drau and the Gail, and the divides in the Toblacher Feld between Innichen and Toblach in Italy, where the Drau empties into the Black Sea and the Rienz into the Adriatic.
Settlements are often built on valley-floor divides in the Alps. Examples are Eben im Pongau, Kirchberg in Tirol and Waidring (In all of these, the village name indicates the pass and the watershed is even explicitly displayed in the coat of arms). Extremely low divides with heights of less than two metres are found on the North German Plain within the Urstromtäler, for example, between Havel and Finow in the Eberswalde Urstromtal. In marsh deltas such as the Okavango, the largest drainage area on earth, or in large lakes areas, such as the Finnish Lakeland, it is difficult to find a meaningful definition of a watershed.
A bifurcation is where the watershed is effectively in a river bed, in a wetland, or underground. The largest watershed of this type is the bifurcation of the Orinoco in the north of South America, whose main stream empties into the Caribbean, but which also drains into the South Atlantic via the Casiquiare canal and Amazon River.

Political boundaries
Since ridgelines are sometimes easy to see and agree about, drainage divides may form natural borders defining political boundaries, as with the Royal Proclamation of 1763 in British North America which coincided with the ridgeline of the Appalachian Mountains forming the Eastern Continental Divide that separated settled colonial lands in the east from Indian Territory to the west. Another instance of a border matching a watershed in modern times involves the western border between Labrador and Quebec, as arbitrated by the privy council in 1927.

Portages and canals
Drainage divides hinder waterway navigation. In pre-industrial times, water divides were crossed at portages. Later, canals connected adjoining drainage basins; a key problem in such canals is ensuring a sufficient water supply. Important examples are the Chicago Portage, connecting the Great Lakes and Mississippi by the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal, and the Canal des Deux Mers in France, connecting the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. The name is enshrined at the Height of Land Portage on the route from the Great Lakes in the Atlantic drainage basin to the Hudson Bay drainage basin.

Mountain Partnership,"The Mountain Partnership is an official United Nations partnership and international voluntary alliance dedicated to improving the lives of mountain peoples and protecting mountain environments around the world.

History
During the preparatory process of the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesberg, South Africa, in 2002, the governments of Italy and Switzerland, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) embarked on an effort to organize a new partnership to strengthen cooperation and more effectively address the needs of mountain peoples and environments around the world. As a result, the International Partnership for Sustainable Development of Mountain Regions, known as the Mountain Partnership, was launched.

Membership
The Mountain Partnership currently has over 550 members, comprising governments, intergovernmental organizations and major groups from civil society, NGOs and the private sector.
The following governments are currently members of the Mountain Partnership.

Secretariat
The Mountain Partnership is supported by a secretariat based at FAO Headquarters in Rome, Italy. The Mountain Partnership Secretariat plays a facilitating role, connecting institutions and helping members develop joint activities to protect mountain regions. It is also responsible for coordinating the annual observance of International Mountain Day and for preparing the United Nations Secretary-General report on sustainable mountain development every three years.
The Mountain Partnership Secretariat is funded by the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Environment, Agriculture and Sustainability of Andorra, FAO, the Swiss Federal Office for Agriculture, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Kyrgyzstan.
The current Coordinator of the Mountain Partnership Secretariat is Rosalaura Romeo. Past coordinators include Thomas Hofer, Yuka Makino, and Doug McGuire.

Work
The work of the Mountain Partnership is spread out among four pillars, namely: advocacy, communications, brokering initiatives and capacity development. The Mountain Partnership works to bring global attention to achieving sustainable development in mountain regions and to promote the inclusion of mountain issues in United Nations declarations and other international documents. Members also engage in disseminating awareness with regards to challenges faced by mountain peoples and environments. Furthermore, the Mountain Partnership’s role is to ""facilitate contacts between countries and institutions and creating conditions for partnerships, technical cooperation and resource mobilization at all levels"". The scope of the Mountain Partnership is for members to cooperate in order to facilitate, promote and implement initiatives at all levels.
The Mountain Partnership’s main principles are ""participation of all members, accountability, responsiveness, consensus, transparency and flexibility"". Its Secretariat is crucial for the creation of an enabling environment for main actors to cooperate towards the obtainment of common aims.
In 2012, its members lobbied for sustainable mountain development to be included in The Future We Want, the final outcome document of the Rio+20 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, resulting in the inclusion of three paragraphs relating to mountains.
The partnership also encourages the development of policies and laws that give local mountain communities a voice in decision-making and organizes conferences, training sessions, workshops and communications materials on sustainable development in mountain areas worldwide.
Thanks to advocacy efforts of the Mountain Partnership members, mountains are mentioned in three targets under two of the 17 goals issued by the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals in its outcome document.

By 2020 protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes
By 2020 ensure conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services, in particular forests, wetlands, mountains and drylands, in line with obligations under international agreements
By 2030 ensure the conservation of mountain ecosystems, including their biodiversity, to enhance their capacity to provide benefits which are essential for sustainable development.
The Sixth Global Meeting of the Mountain Partnership was convened in Aspen, Colorado, on 27–29 September 2022, with over 200 participants attending. It was the main event of the United Nations International Year of Sustainable Mountain Development 2022. Delegates elected a new Steering Committee for the Mountain Partnership, updated several of the Mountain Partnership’s strategy documents, and endorsed the Aspen Declaration.

Island castle,"The island castle, or insular castle, is a variation of the water castle. It is distinguished by its location on an artificial or natural island. It is a typical lowland castle.
Because the island on which the castle was erected is separated from the shore by at least two bodies of water, artificial defences such as moats or shield walls were usually unnecessary if the castle was surrounded by flowing water. Such castles could therefore be very easily and cheaply built. Many island castles in lakes were, however, relatively easily captured in winter if there was an ice sheet thick enough to support attacking troops, because they were often rather poorly fortified.

European island castles
The best-known island castle in Germany is Pfalzgrafenstein Castle near Kaub, Rhineland-Palatinate
The Chateau d'If is situated on the southern coast of France
The English counterpart to Mont-Saint-Michel is St Michael's Mount in Cornwall
Piel Castle was built on Piel Island of the coast of the Furness peninsula in England
Switzerland's iconic Chillon Castle sits on a small island on the eastern end of Lake Geneva
The Aragonese Castle is situated in the Gulf of Naples
The only water castle in Europe that utilizes Gothic architecture is Trakai Castle in Lithuania

Note: Mont-Saint-Michel in Normandy is not a castle as many people believe, it is a fortified monastery.

Island castles in South Asia
Though not entirely a castle, really consisting of a fort surrounding a palace, Murud-Janjira is a famous island fortress off the Indian coast in the Arabian Sea. The fortress is relatively unique in that the outermost defensive walls of the compound entirely encompass the island's natural land, thwarting any attacks using traditional amphibious landings.

Liberature,"Liberature is literature in which the material form is considered an important part of the whole and essential to understanding the work.

Description of liberature
Liberature refers to a new kind of literature, a trans-genre, in which the text and the material form of a book constitute an inseparable whole. The term itself is derived from the word 'literature', but draws from the Latin liber, meaning ""a book"" and ""the free one"", as well as libra meaning ""measurement"" or ""writing as a measurement of words."" In a work of liberature, text does not serve as the sole source of meaning; the shape and the construction of the book, its format, the number of pages, its typographical layout, the size and type of the font applied, pictures and photographs integrated with the text, and type of paper or other material used in the process of creation of the book are all taken into consideration. The reader confronts a work of liberature as a total package, which often assumes a non-traditional shape, the quality of which, in practice, sometime involves a radical separation from the traditional design of the book. Its textual message dictates the physical shape that the work finally assumes. All of this lends a level of intent and control to the creator of liberature that surpasses that of other genres.
The demands posed by liberature shape a new kind of reader. In traditional texts, the reader empirically processes the text of a work in order to attain a desired level of understanding; one follows the steps of a model reader, whose purpose is to bring oneself closer to one's virtual model. Certain works diverge from this concept of linear, textual reading such as those by Umberto Eco or Roland Barthes. Such works introduce uncertainty into these structured expectations and programs of behavior. Neither the works of Eco nor Barthes constitute liberature, but they exemplify a difference in the quality of the programming of the reader's experience.
The printed works of liberature, although diverse in the application, share the following variables of the traversal function:

Only in several instances the work may breach the above-mentioned scheme of characteristic variables of liberature. In all other cases, readers are responsible for configuring their reading of the text.
Texts of liberature that generate multiple statements are not limited to literary works, and definitely not to electronic texts – the category embraces computer games and other forms of both ergodic and non‐ergodic literature. The former requires a non‐trivial effort to traverse the text. In a classical, non-ergodic literary work, such as The Odyssey, the reader is required only to turn the pages and to interpret the text.
In permutative works – those in which the order of text is inconsequential - instead of static function defining the dynamics, something else occurs.  An intratextonic dynamic, one that guides the reader throughout the text, occurs. The text is also not determinate, meaning that it lacks a specificity which would hinder interpretation and different readings. The ergodic character of the work is usually determined by the exploratory function of the reader.
The parallel character of the works is written into the very core of liberature; the order in which the reader perceives the text governs the way the work is rendered. The interactive capacity of the work becomes, if not an aesthetic category, a way of the reader's behavior that is written into the text. The work of liberature disrupts the structure of expectations based on a syntagmatic order as well as the strategies characteristic of a linear text. The works of liberature refer to the experience of simultaneousness. Furthermore, liberature as a hybrid genre incorporating the features of numerous media at the same time, including the arts, assumes a quality of simultaneousness as a dominating one.

Creation of the concept. Liberature avant la lettre
In 1999, Zenon Fajfer postulated the genre of liberature to describe the yet-undefinable work Oka-leczenie that he and Katarzyna Bazarnik had been working on. In a translated explanation of the concept, Fajfer describes liberature as ""a type or genre of literature in which the text is integrated with the physical space of the book into a meaningful whole and in which all elements (from the graphic ones to the kinds of paper (or other material) and the physical shape of the book) may contribute to its meaning"". Fajfer specifically cites the necessity of creating the genre because he too often sees non-traditional literary works judged only as works of art, but not as literature. After conception, the idea was developed by Katarzyna Bazarnik who, basing her reflections on the analysis of the works by James Joyce, demonstrated that the similarity of the text and the form creates iconicity. By exploring and dynamically developing the study of iconicity, a common feature of liberature, Bazarnik contributed to the consideration of liberature i",Literature,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberature,0,liberature literature material form considered important part whole essential understanding work description liberature liberature refers new kind literature transgenre text material form book constitute inseparable whole term derived word literature draw latin liber meaning book free one well libra meaning measurement writing measurement word work liberature text serve sole source meaning shape construction book format number page typographical layout size type font applied picture photograph integrated text type paper material used process creation book taken consideration reader confronts work liberature total package often assumes nontraditional shape quality practice sometime involves radical separation traditional design book textual message dictate physical shape work finally assumes lends level intent control creator liberature surpasses genre demand posed liberature shape new kind reader traditional text reader empirically process text work order attain desired level understanding one follows step model reader whose purpose bring oneself closer one virtual model certain work diverge concept linear textual reading umberto eco roland barthes work introduce uncertainty structured expectation program behavior neither work eco barthes constitute liberature exemplify difference quality programming reader experience printed work liberature although diverse application share following variable traversal function several instance work may breach abovementioned scheme characteristic variable liberature case reader responsible configuring reading text text liberature generate multiple statement limited literary work definitely electronic text – category embrace computer game form ergodic non‐ergodic literature former requires non‐trivial effort traverse text classical nonergodic literary work odyssey reader required turn page interpret text permutative work – order text inconsequential instead static function defining dynamic something else occurs intratextonic dynamic one guide reader throughout text occurs text also determinate meaning lack specificity would hinder interpretation different reading ergodic character work usually determined exploratory function reader parallel character work written core liberature order reader perceives text governs way work rendered interactive capacity work becomes aesthetic category way reader behavior written text work liberature disrupts structure expectation based syntagmatic order well strategy characteristic linear text work liberature refer experience simultaneousness furthermore liberature hybrid genre incorporating feature numerous medium time including art assumes quality simultaneousness dominating one creation concept liberature avant la lettre zenon fajfer postulated genre liberature describe yetundefinable work okaleczenie katarzyna bazarnik working translated explanation concept fajfer describes liberature type genre literature text integrated physical space book meaningful whole element graphic one kind paper material physical shape book may contribute meaning fajfer specifically cite necessity creating genre often see nontraditional literary work judged work art literature conception idea developed katarzyna bazarnik basing reflection analysis work james joyce demonstrated similarity text form creates iconicity exploring dynamically developing study iconicity common feature liberature bazarnik contributed consideration liberature
Channel types,"A wide variety of river and stream channel types exist in limnology, the study of inland waters. All these can be divided into two groups by using the water-flow gradient as either low gradient channels for streams or rivers with less than two percent (2%) flow gradient, or high gradient channels for those with greater than a 2% gradient.

Low gradient channels
Low gradient channels of rivers and streams can be divided into braided rivers, wandering rivers, single thread sinuous rivers (meandering), and anastomosing rivers. The channel type developed depends on stream gradient, riparian vegetation and sediment supply. Braided rivers tend to occur on steeper gradients where there is a large supply of sediment for braid bars, while single thread sinuous channels occur where there is a lower sediment supply for point bars. Anastomosing channels are multithreaded, but are much more stable than braided channels and commonly have thick clay and silt banks and occur at lower gradients of stream bed. Wandering rivers fall between sinuous single thread and braided streams and are relatively stable multi-channel gravel bed rivers.

High gradient channels
High gradient channels of rivers and streams have been divided into riffle-pool (which can cover all of the low gradient channel morphologies discussed above), rapid/plane bed, step-pool and cascade unit morphologies. 

Riffle-pool sequence channels are composed of migrating pools and transverse bars called riffles and occur on gradients less than 1-2 percent.
Rapids (also called plane bed, but not to be confused with the plane beds described in sand bed rivers) lack distinct pools and bars but commonly have stone cells or clusters and occur on gradients in the range of 1-5 percent, and have ""whitewater"".
Step-pools are composed of channel-spanning pools and boulder/cobble steps that cause subcritical flow in the pool and supercritical flow over the steps.  They occur in gradients in the range of 5 and 20%.
Cascade units exist at steeper gradients (approx > 10–15 percent) where the channel is dominated by boulders and cobbles and channel spanning pools do not exist.  Pocket pools are common.  In all four channel types large woody debris may strongly influence the channel type.

Country,"A country is a distinct part of the world, such as a state, nation, or other political entity. When referring to a specific polity, the term ""country"" may refer to a sovereign state, state with limited recognition, constituent country, or dependent territory. Most sovereign states, but not all countries, are members of the United Nations. There is no universal agreement on the number of ""countries"" in the world, since several states have disputed sovereignty status or limited recognition, and a number of non-sovereign entities are commonly considered countries.
The definition and usage of the word ""country"" are flexible and have changed over time. The Economist wrote in 2010 that ""any attempt to find a clear definition of a country soon runs into a thicket of exceptions and anomalies.""
Areas much smaller than a political entity may be referred to as a ""country"", such as the West Country in England, ""big sky country"" (used in various contexts of the American West), ""coal country"" (used to describe coal-mining regions), or simply ""the country"" (used to describe a rural area). The term ""country"" is also used as a qualifier descriptively, such as country music or country living.

Etymology
The word country comes from Old French contrée, which derives from Vulgar Latin (terra) contrata (""(land) lying opposite""; ""(land) spread before""), derived from contra (""against, opposite""). It most likely entered the English language after the Franco-Norman invasion during the 11th century.

Definition of a country
In English, the word has increasingly become associated with political divisions, so that one sense, associated with the indefinite article – ""a country"" – is now frequently applied as a synonym for a state or a former sovereign state. It may also be used as a synonym for ""nation"". Taking as examples Canada, Sri Lanka, and Yugoslavia, cultural anthropologist Clifford Geertz wrote in 1997 that ""it is clear that the relationships between 'country' and 'nation' are so different from one [place] to the next as to be impossible to fold into a dichotomous opposition as they are into a promiscuous fusion.""
Areas much smaller than a political state may be referred to as countries, such as the West Country in England, ""big sky country"" (used in various contexts of the American West), ""coal country"" (used to describe coal-mining regions in several sovereign states) and many other terms. The word ""country"" is also used for the sense of native sovereign territory, such as the widespread use of Indian country in the United States.
The term ""country"" in English may also be wielded to describe rural areas, or used in the form ""countryside."" Raymond Williams, a Welsh scholar, wrote in 1975:

'Country' and 'city' are very powerful words, and this is not surprising when we remember how much they seem to stand for in the experience of human communities. In English, 'country' is both a nation and a part of a 'land'; 'the country' can be the whole society or its rural area. In the long history of human settlements, this connection between the land from which directly or indirectly we all get our living and the achievements of human society has been deeply known.
The unclear definition of ""country"" in modern English was further commented upon by philosopher Simon Keller:

Often, a country is presumed to be identical with a collection of citizens. Sometimes, people say that a country is a project, or an idea, or an ideal. Occasionally, philosophers entertain more metaphysically ambitious pictures, suggesting that a country is an organic entity with its own independent life and character, or that a country is an autonomous agent, just like you or me. Such claims are rarely explained or defended, however, and it is not clear how they should be assessed. We attribute so many different kinds of properties to countries, speaking as though a country can feature wheat fields waving or be girt by sea, can have a founding date and be democratic and free, can be English speaking, culturally diverse, war torn or Islamic.Melissa Lucashenko, an Aboriginal Australian writer, expressed the difficulty of defining ""country"" in a 2005 essay, ""Unsettlement"":
...What is this thing country? What does country
mean? ... I spoke with others who said country meant Home, but who added the caveat that Home resided in people rather than places – a kind of portable Country... I tried to tease out some ways in which non-Indigenous people have understood country. I made categories: Country as Economy. Country as Geography. Country as Society. Country as Myth. Country as History. For all that I walked, slept, breathed and dreamed Country, the language still would not come.

Economic restructuring,"Economic restructuring is used to indicate changes in the constituent parts of an economy in a very general sense. In the western world, it is usually used to refer to the phenomenon of urban areas shifting from a manufacturing to a service sector economic base. It has profound implications for productive capacities and competitiveness of cities and regions.  This transformation has affected demographics including income distribution, employment, and social hierarchy; institutional arrangements including the growth of the corporate complex, specialized producer services, capital mobility, informal economy, nonstandard work, and public outlays; as well as geographic spacing including the rise of world cities, spatial mismatch, and metropolitan growth differentials.

Demographic impact
As cities experience a loss of manufacturing jobs and growth of services, sociologist Saskia Sassen affirms that a widening of the social hierarchy occurs where high-level, high-income, salaried professional jobs expands in the service industries alongside a greater incidence of low-wage, low-skilled jobs, usually filled by immigrants and minorities. A ""missing middle"" eventually develops in the wage structure. Several effects of this social polarization include the increasing concentration of poverty in large U.S. cities, the increasing concentration of black and Hispanic populations in large U.S. cities, and distinct social forms such as the underclass, informal economy, and entrepreneurial immigrant communities. In addition, the declining manufacturing sector leaves behind strained blue-collared workers who endure chronic unemployment, economic insecurity, and stagnation due to the global economy's capital flight. Wages and unionization rates for manufacturing jobs also decline. One other qualitative dimension involves the feminization of the job supply as more and more women enter the labor force usually in the service sector.
Both costs and benefits are associated with economic restructuring. Greater efficiency, job creation, gentrification, and enhanced national competitiveness are associated with social exclusion and inclusion. The low-skilled, low-income population faces the loss of opportunities, full participation in society, lack of access in labor market and school, weak position in housing markets, limited political participation, and restricted social-cultural integration. Conversely, high-skilled, high-income professionals enjoy social inclusion with modern amenities, conveniences, social participation, and full access to public resources.
Furthermore, sociologist William Julius Wilson argues that the deindustrialization of manufacturing employment have exacerbated joblessness in impoverished African American communities correlating with a rise in single-mother households, high premature mortality rates, and increasing incarceration rates among African American males. With some African Americans gaining professional upward mobility through affirmative action and equal opportunity sanctions in education and employment, African Americans without such opportunities fall behind. This creates a growing economic class division among the African American demographic accentuated by global economic restructuring without government response to the disadvantaged. Furthermore, Wilson asserts that as the black middle class leave the predominantly black inner city neighborhoods, informal employment information networks are eroded. This isolates poor, inner city residents from the labor market compounding the concentration of poverty, welfare dependency, rise of unemployment, and physical isolation in these areas.
City youth are also affected such as in New York City. The declines in education, health care, and social services and the dearth of jobs for those with limited education and training along with the decay of public environments for outdoor play and recreation have all contributed to fewer autonomous outdoor play or ""hanging out"" places for young people. This in turn affects their gross motor development, cultural build-up, and identity construction. Children become prisoners of home relying on television and other outlets for companionship. Contemporary urban environments restricts the opportunities for children to forge and negotiate peer culture or acquire necessary social skills. Overall, their ecologies have eroded in recent years brought about by global restructuring.

Institutional arrangements
When the 1973 oil crisis affected the world capitalist economy, economic restructuring was used to remedy the situation by geographically redistributing production, consumption, and residences.
City economies across the globe moved from goods-producing to service-producing outlets.
Breakthroughs in transportation and communications made industrial capital much more mobile.

Circular flow land use management,"Circular flow land use management, or CircUse, is a name for a particular process in which neglected land in urban areas is put to better uses. CircUse as a concept aims to be integrated with existing structures and uses, and is put into practice on a broad scale. The concept also looks to reduce the consumption of un-built land through prioritizing inner development over outer development. In Germany the approach of circular flow land use management has been developed and tested by the German Institute for Urban Affairs (Deutsches Institut für Urbanistik) on behalf of the German Federal Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Affairs (BMVBS) and German Federal Office for Building and Regional Planning (BBR).

Concept of Land Use
The concept of circular flow land use management can be described with the slogan “reduce – recycle – avoid”. To create sustainable land uses, actions have to be supported to find new innovative ways to “reduce” the consumption of land by new development “recycle” or put back into use abandoned and derelict sites, and “avoid” future land use decisions that are not sustainable. The concept puts a high value upon the development of inner districts through infill measures.
This approach takes into consideration issues related to urban sprawl, urban planning, brownfield land, and land use planning. The concept was developed by the German Institute for Urban Affairs (Difu) and the Federal Office for Building and Regional Planning (BBR) between 2003 and 2007 during the ExWoSt research field “circular land use management in cities and urban regions” (Kreislaufwirtschaft in der städtischen/stadtregionalen Flächennuntzung -. Fläche im Kreis)

Practical application
To incorporate the circular flow land use management concept into the practice of city planning in Central Europe, the project “Circular Flow Land Use Management (CircUse)” was initiated by the European Union Central Europe organization  as well as co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund. The CircUse project involves 12 partner organizations and 3 associated organizations in the six countries of Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, Poland and Slovakia. The lead organization is the Institute for the Ecology of Urban Areas (IETU), located in Katowice, Poland.
The main core outputs of the CircUse project will be:

A Circular Flow Land Use Management Strategy
Position paper on existing and new instruments
Separate training materials for professionals and school children
Management structures (one newly formed and another modified from its previous form) that incorporate the CircUse principles
Developed action plans for six pilot regions
A land management data tool available as a software package
A compendium summarizing the entire project

Timeframe
The CircUse project was initiated in March 2010 and is scheduled to run until the end of February 2013.

Similar projects
CircUse also builds on the experiences the German ""ExWoSt Research Field: Circular land use management in cities and urban regions” (ExWoSt Themafeld: Kreislaufwirtschaft in der städtischen/stadtregionalen Flächennutzung)  and the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) Research Programme ""Research for the Reduction of Land Consumption and for Sustainable Land Management"" (Forschung für die Reduzierung der Flächeninanspruchnahme und ein nachhaltiges Flächenmanagement). Similar projects carried out by other organizations include the European Union PLUREL project.

Open and closed lakes,"Open and closed lakes refer to the major subdivisions of lakes – bodies of water surrounded by land.  Exorheic, or open, lakes drain into a river or other body of water that ultimately drains into the ocean. Endorheic basins fall into the category of endorheic or closed lakes, wherein waters do not drain into the ocean, but are reduced by evaporation, and/or drain into the ground.

Open lake
An open lake is a lake where water constantly flows out under almost all climatic circumstances. Because water does not remain in an open lake for any length of time, dissolved solids do not accumulate, and such lakes are usually fresh water. Open lakes form in areas where precipitation is greater than evaporation. Because most of the world's water is found in areas of highly effective rainfall, most lakes are open lakes whose water eventually reaches the sea. For instance, the Great Lakes' water flows into the St. Lawrence River and eventually the Atlantic Ocean.
Open lakes typically have relatively stable water levels that do not fluctuate, as input is always matched by outflow to rivers downstream. If more water enters an open lake than was previously leaving it, then more water will leave the lake. The drainage from an open lake, like that from ordinary rivers, is referred to as exorheic (from the Greek exos, outside and rhein, to flow).

Closed lake
In a closed lake (see endorheic drainage), no water flows out. Water that is not evaporated will remain in a closed lake indefinitely. This means that closed lakes are usually saline, though this salinity varies greatly from around three parts per thousand for most of the Caspian Sea to as much as 400 parts per thousand for the Dead Sea. Only the less salty closed lakes are able to sustain life, and it is completely different from that in rivers or freshwater open lakes. Closed lakes typically form in areas where evaporation is greater than rainfall, although most closed lakes actually obtain their water from a region with much higher precipitation than the area around the lake itself, which is often a depression of some sort.
The level of most closed lakes is unstable because if runoff into the lake is lessened, the water balance of a closed lake is altered, and the amount of water in the lake falls. This is what has caused the shrinkage of the Aral Sea, formerly the world's second largest closed lake. Similarly, if runoff into a closed lake is increased, then the level will increase because evaporation is not likely to increase at all - let alone enough to stabilise the level of the lake.
Fluctuation in the level of closed lakes is therefore much more useful in paleoclimatology than are studies of open lakes which can reduce the level of outflow if inflow decreases.

Conversion between an open and a closed lake
If the amount of water entering a closed lake is increased beyond a certain level—for most closed lakes far more than would normally enter the lake—it is possible that the water level in the lake would rise so much that the lake would no longer be capable of containing it. This is rare but known conclusively in the case of Lake Corangamite in southern Victoria, when a succession of wet years during the 1950s caused the level of the lake to rise so much that it almost overflowed. There is a great deal of evidence that Lake Corangamite was an open lake prior to the end of the Little Ice Age - some evidence says it was an open lake for much of the Holocene due to a wetter climate.
It is also possible that the inflow into an open lake could decrease so much that any outflow would dry the lake up completely; that is, the open lake would become a closed lake. The only lake that is currently an open lake for which there is any evidence of a closed lake existing in the same location in the past is Lake Malawi in Africa. It is known that in very dry periods, outflow from the Shire River—Lake Malawi's only outlet—can drop precipitously, and it is strongly believed that during past dry periods outflow from Lake Malawi has ceased entirely and salt has accumulated in the lake, especially during the Last Glacial Maximum and other similarly dry periods.
Apart from Australia and Southern Africa, it is rare for runoff variability to be high enough for these changes to take place on a useful time scale, and lakes forming in areas where conversions from closed to open or open to closed are likely are very rare. However, Lake Titicaca, the largest lake in South America, has historically been a semi-open lake with very limited outflow, but recent glacial retreat has reduced inflows so much that some believe it could become a completely closed lake in the future. North Dakota's Devils Lake, historically a closed lake, is known to have been an open lake during the Medieval Warm Period. 
Since 1999, possibly due to global warming, Devils Lake has overflowed into another terminus called Stump Lake, which could overflow into the Red River of the North if present wet conditions in the re",Lakes,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_and_closed_lakes,1,open closed lake refer major subdivision lake – body water surrounded land exorheic open lake drain river body water ultimately drain ocean endorheic basin fall category endorheic closed lake wherein water drain ocean reduced evaporation andor drain ground open lake open lake lake water constantly flow almost climatic circumstance water remain open lake length time dissolved solid accumulate lake usually fresh water open lake form area precipitation greater evaporation world water found area highly effective rainfall lake open lake whose water eventually reach sea instance great lake water flow st lawrence river eventually atlantic ocean open lake typically relatively stable water level fluctuate input always matched outflow river downstream water enters open lake previously leaving water leave lake drainage open lake like ordinary river referred exorheic greek exos outside rhein flow closed lake closed lake see endorheic drainage water flow water evaporated remain closed lake indefinitely mean closed lake usually saline though salinity varies greatly around three part per thousand caspian sea much part per thousand dead sea less salty closed lake able sustain life completely different river freshwater open lake closed lake typically form area evaporation greater rainfall although closed lake actually obtain water region much higher precipitation area around lake often depression sort level closed lake unstable runoff lake lessened water balance closed lake altered amount water lake fall caused shrinkage aral sea formerly world second largest closed lake similarly runoff closed lake increased level increase evaporation likely increase let alone enough stabilise level lake fluctuation level closed lake therefore much useful paleoclimatology study open lake reduce level outflow inflow decrease conversion open closed lake amount water entering closed lake increased beyond certain level—for closed lake far would normally enter lake—it possible water level lake would rise much lake would longer capable containing rare known conclusively case lake corangamite southern victoria succession wet year caused level lake rise much almost overflowed great deal evidence lake corangamite open lake prior end little ice age evidence say open lake much holocene due wetter climate also possible inflow open lake could decrease much outflow would dry lake completely open lake would become closed lake lake currently open lake evidence closed lake existing location past lake malawi africa known dry period outflow shire river—lake malawi outlet—can drop precipitously strongly believed past dry period outflow lake malawi ceased entirely salt accumulated lake especially last glacial maximum similarly dry period apart australia southern africa rare runoff variability high enough change take place useful time scale lake forming area conversion closed open open closed likely rare however lake titicaca largest lake south america historically semiopen lake limited outflow recent glacial retreat reduced inflow much believe could become completely closed lake future north dakota devil lake historically closed lake known open lake medieval warm period since possibly due global warming devil lake overflowed another terminus called stump lake could overflow red river north present wet condition
Music,"Music is the arrangement of sound to create some combination of form, harmony, melody, rhythm, or otherwise expressive content. Music is generally agreed to be a cultural universal that is present in all human societies. Definitions of music vary widely in substance and approach. While scholars agree that music is defined by a small number of specific elements, there is no consensus as to what these necessary elements are. Music is often characterized as a highly versatile medium for expressing human creativity. Diverse activities are involved in the creation of music, and are often divided into categories of composition, improvisation, and performance. Music may be performed using a wide variety of musical instruments, including the human voice. It can also be composed, sequenced, or otherwise produced to be indirectly played mechanically or electronically, such as via a music box, barrel organ, or digital audio workstation software on a computer.
Music often plays a key role in social events and religious ceremonies. The techniques of making music are often transmitted as part of a cultural tradition. Music is played in public and private contexts, highlighted at events such as festivals and concerts for various different types of ensembles. Music is used in the production of other media, such as in soundtracks to films, TV shows, operas, and video games.
Listening to music is a common means of entertainment. The culture surrounding music extends into areas of academic study, journalism, philosophy, psychology, and therapy. The music industry includes songwriters, performers, sound engineers, producers, tour organizers, distributors of instruments, accessories, and publishers of sheet music and recordings. Technology facilitating the recording and reproduction of music has historically included sheet music, microphones, phonographs, and tape machines, with playback of digital musics being a common use for MP3 players, CD players, and smartphones.

Etymology and terminology
The modern English word 'music' came into use in the 1630s. It is derived from a long line of successive precursors: the Old English 'musike' of the mid-13th century; the Old French musique of the 12th century; and the Latin mūsica. The Latin word itself derives from the Ancient Greek mousiké (technē)—μουσική (τέχνη)—literally meaning ""(art) of the Muses"". The Muses were nine deities in Ancient Greek mythology who presided over the arts and sciences. They were included in tales by the earliest Western authors, Homer and Hesiod, and eventually came to be associated with music specifically. Over time, Polyhymnia would reside over music more prominently than the other muses. The Latin word musica was also the originator for both the Spanish música and French musique via spelling and linguistic adjustment, though other European terms were probably loanwords, including the Italian musica, German Musik, Dutch muziek, Norwegian musikk, Polish muzyka and Russian muzïka.
The modern Western world usually defines music as an all-encompassing term used to describe diverse genres, styles, and traditions. This is not the case worldwide, and languages such as modern Indonesian (musik) and Shona (musakazo) have recently adopted words to reflect this universal conception, as they did not have words that fit exactly the Western scope. Before Western contact in East Asia, neither Japan nor China had a single word that encompasses music in a broad sense, but culturally, they often regarded music in such a fashion. The closest word to mean music in Chinese, yue, shares a character with le, meaning joy, and originally referred to all the arts before narrowing in meaning. Africa is too diverse to make firm generalizations, but the musicologist J. H. Kwabena Nketia has emphasized African music's often inseparable connection to dance and speech in general. Some African cultures, such as the Songye people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Tiv people of Nigeria, have a strong and broad conception of 'music' but no corresponding word in their native languages. Other words commonly translated as 'music' often have more specific meanings in their respective cultures: the Hindi word for music, sangita, properly refers to art music, while the many Indigenous languages of the Americas have words for music that refer specifically to song but describe instrumental music regardless. Though the Persian musiqi can refer to all music, it is usually used for instrumental and metric music, while khandan identifies vocal and improvised music.

History
Origins and prehistory
It is often debated to what extent the origins of music will ever be understood, and there are competing theories that aim to explain it. Many scholars highlight a relationship between the origin of music and the origin of language, and there is disagreement surrounding whether music developed before, after, or simultaneously with language.

Continental fragment,"Continental crustal fragments, partly synonymous with microcontinents, are pieces of continents that have broken off from main continental masses to form distinct islands that are often several hundred kilometers from their place of origin.

Causes
Continental fragments and microcontinent crustal compositions are very similar to those of regular continental crust. The rifting process that caused the continental fragments to form most likely impacts their layers and overall thickness along with the addition of mafic intrusions to the crust. Studies have determined that the average crustal thickness of continental fragments is approximately 24.8 ± 5.7 kilometres (15.4 ± 3.5 mi). The sedimentary layer of continental fragments can be up to 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) thick and can overlay two to three crustal layers. Continental fragments have an average crustal density of 2.81 g/cm3 (0.102 lb/cu in) which is very similar to that of typical continental crust.
Strike-slip fault zones cause the fragmentation of microcontinents. The zones link the extensional zones where continental pieces are already isolated through the remaining continental bridges. Additionally, they facilitate quick crustal thinning across narrow zones and near-vertical strike-slip-dominated faults. They develop fault-block patterns that slice the portion of continent into detachable slivers. The continental fragments are located at various angles from their transform faults.

History
Some microcontinents are fragments of Gondwana or other ancient cratonic continents; examples include Madagascar; the northern Mascarene Plateau, which includes the Seychelles Microcontinent; and the island of Timor. Other islands, such as several in the Caribbean Sea, are composed largely of granitic rock as well, but all continents contain both granitic and basaltic crust, and there is no clear dividing line between islands and microcontinents under such a definition. The Kerguelen Plateau is a large igneous province formed by a volcanic hotspot; however, it was associated with the breakup of Gondwana and was for a time above water, so it is considered a microcontinent, though not a continental fragment. Other hotspot islands such as the Hawaiian Islands and Iceland are considered neither microcontinents nor continental fragments. Not all islands can be considered microcontinents: Borneo, the British Isles, Newfoundland, and Sri Lanka, for example, are each within the continental shelf of an adjacent continent, separated from the mainland by inland seas flooding its margins.
Several islands in the eastern Indonesian Archipelago are considered continental fragments, although this designation is controversial. The archipelago is home to numerous microcontinents with complex geology and tectonics. This makes it complicated to classify landmasses and determine causation for the formation of the landmass. These include southern Bacan, Banggai-Sulu Islands (Sulawesi), the Buru-Seram-Ambon complex (Maluku), Obi, Sumba, and Timor (Nusa Tenggara)

Patterns
Shoreline development correlates strongly with lake area, although this partly reflects the scale dependence of the index (see Limitations). To some extent, the shoreline development index reflects the mode of origin for lakes. For example, volcanic crater lakes often have shoreline development index values near 1, where are fluvial oxbow lakes often have very high shoreline development index values.

Application to lakes with islands
The index can also include the length of island shoreline, modifying the formula to

 is the combined length of the lake's islands' shoreline.

Limitations
Lake shorelines are fractal. This means that measurements of shore length are longer when measured on high-resolution maps compared to low-resolution maps. Therefore, a lake's shoreline development index will be greater when calculated based on shorelines measured from high-resolution maps compared to low-resolution maps. Consequently, shoreline development index values cannot be compared for lakes with shorelines measured from maps with different scales. Additionally, the shoreline development index cannot be compared for lakes with different surface areas because large lakes automatically have higher values than smaller lakes, even if they have the same planform shape. Hence the shoreline development index can only be used to compare lakes with the same surface area that are also mapped at the same scale. Making comparisons like this can create spurious correlations between the shoreline development index and ecological variables.

Lake metabolism,"Lake metabolism represents a lake's balance between carbon fixation (gross primary production) and biological carbon oxidation (ecosystem respiration). Whole-lake metabolism includes the carbon fixation and oxidation from all organism within the lake, from bacteria to fishes, and is typically estimated by measuring changes in dissolved oxygen or carbon dioxide throughout the day.
Ecosystem respiration in excess of gross primary production indicates the lake receives organic material from the surrounding catchment, such as through stream or groundwater inflows or litterfall. Lake metabolism often controls the carbon dioxide emissions from or influx to lakes, but it does not account for all carbon dioxide dynamics since inputs of inorganic carbon from the surrounding catchment also influence carbon dioxide within lakes.

Concept
Estimates of lake metabolism typically rely on the measurement of dissolved oxygen or carbon dioxide, or measurements of a carbon or oxygen tracer to estimate production and consumption of organic carbon. Oxygen is produced and carbon dioxide consumed through photosynthesis and oxygen is consumed and carbon dioxide produced through respiration.  Here, organic matter is symbolized by glucose, though the chemical species produced and respired through these reactions vary widely.

Measurement techniques
Estimating lake metabolism requires approximating processes that influence the production and consumption of organic carbon by organisms within the lake. Cyclical changes on a daily scale occur in most lakes on Earth because sunlight is available for photosynthesis and production of new carbon only for a portion of the day. Researchers can take advantage of this diel pattern to measure rates of change in carbon itself or changes in dissolved gases such as carbon dioxide or oxygen that occur on a daily scale. Although daily estimates of metabolism are most common, whole-lake metabolism can be integrated over longer time periods such as seasonal or annual rates by estimating a whole-lake carbon budget. The following sections highlight the most common ways to estimate lake metabolism across a variety of temporal and spatial scales and go over some of the assumptions of each of these methods.

Free-water methods
Measurement of diel changes in dissolved gases within the lake, also known as the ""free-water"" method, has quickly become the most common method of estimating lake metabolism since the wide",Lakes,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_metabolism,1,lake metabolism represents lake balance carbon fixation gross primary production biological carbon oxidation ecosystem respiration wholelake metabolism includes carbon fixation oxidation organism within lake bacteria fish typically estimated measuring change dissolved oxygen carbon dioxide throughout day ecosystem respiration excess gross primary production indicates lake receives organic material surrounding catchment stream groundwater inflow litterfall lake metabolism often control carbon dioxide emission influx lake account carbon dioxide dynamic since input inorganic carbon surrounding catchment also influence carbon dioxide within lake concept estimate lake metabolism typically rely measurement dissolved oxygen carbon dioxide measurement carbon oxygen tracer estimate production consumption organic carbon oxygen produced carbon dioxide consumed photosynthesis oxygen consumed carbon dioxide produced respiration organic matter symbolized glucose though chemical specie produced respired reaction vary widely photosynthesis c h → l g h c h displaystyle cohoxrightarrowlightchoo respiration c h → c h displaystyle chooxrightarrowcoho photosynthesis oxygen production occurs presence light consumption oxygen via respiration occurs presence absence light lake metabolism term include gpp gross primary production eg total photosynthesis r total respiration r h r displaystyle rhra r h displaystyle rh heterotrophic respiration r displaystyle ra autotrophic respiration nep net ecosystem production gpp r npp net primary production gpp r displaystyle ra measurement technique estimating lake metabolism requires approximating process influence production consumption organic carbon organism within lake cyclical change daily scale occur lake earth sunlight available photosynthesis production new carbon portion day researcher take advantage diel pattern measure rate change carbon change dissolved gas carbon dioxide oxygen occur daily scale although daily estimate metabolism common wholelake metabolism integrated longer time period seasonal annual rate estimating wholelake carbon budget following section highlight common way estimate lake metabolism across variety temporal spatial scale go assumption method freewater method measurement diel change dissolved gas within lake also known freewater method quickly become common method estimating lake metabolism since wide
Anticipatory plagiarism,"Anticipatory plagiarism is a concept first introduced by the Oulipo group of poets. The concept involves the study of historical literature to uncover works which either use, or refer to, constraint- or rule-based writing methods as defined by members of the Oulipo group. The Oulipo poets called these past writers 'anticipatory plagiarists'.
The paradoxical concept of anticipatory plagiarism has more recently been proposed as an analytical tool with reference to Russian studies.

List of anticipatory plagiarists (according to the Oulipo group)
Jonathan Swift and his literary invention called The Engine, in his 1726 novel Gulliver's Travels
Joe Brainard's I Remember

Outline of literature,"The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to literature:
Literature – prose, written or oral, including fiction and non-fiction, drama, and poetry.

See also the Outline of poetry.

What type of thing is literature?
Literature can be described as all of the following:

Communication – activity of conveying information. Communication requires a sender, a message, and an intended recipient, although the receiver need not be present or aware of the sender's intent to communicate at the time of communication; thus communication can occur across vast distances in time and space.
Written communication (writing) – representation of language in a textual medium through the use of a set of signs or symbols (known as a writing system).
Subdivision of culture – shared attitudes, values, goals, and practices that characterizes an institution, organization, or group.
One of the arts – imaginative, creative, or nonscientific branch of knowledge, especially as studied academically.

Deep-sea mining regulations in Nauru,"On 25 June 2021, the president of Nauru, Lionel Aingimea, made a formal request to the president of the International Seabed Authority's (ISA) council to complete the adoption of rules, regulations and procedures necessary to facilitate the approval of plans of work for exploitation of deep-sea resources in the Area. This request is based on the ""2-year rule"", which is part of a provision from the 1994 Agreement relating to the Implementation of Part XI of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The provision can be found in section 1 of the annex, and it states that the ISA must complete the adoption of rules, regulations and procedures for the approval of the exploitation of deep-sea minerals within 2 years of the request. The ISA's current deadline for drafting new regulation is set in July 2023, although some claim that this is not a ""hard"" or ""fixed"" deadline. Due to the issue's complexity, negotiations have thus far failed to come to a concrete agreement. Even if it fails to set clear standards for deep-sea mining activities, the ISA must consider applications for exploitation in waters outside national jurisdictions and provisionally approve contracts after July 2023. Many experts fear that deep-sea mining activities that are not adequately regulated could significantly impact the marine environment, the economies of many nations and the livelihoods of indigenous groups who depend on the oceans for survival.

Existing regulation for deep-sea mining activities
According to Article 157 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), all mineral-related activities in areas beyond national jurisdictions (referred to as The Area in UNCLOS) are organized and controlled by The International Seabed Authority (ISA), especially the administration of resources. Article 136 of UNCLOS states that The Area and its resources are the common heritage of mankind. Article 137 further states that no state can claim sovereignty over the Area and its resources and that the ISA must act on behalf of all mankind when regulating the deep sea. Another essential responsibility of the ISA is adequately protecting the marine environment from potential harmful consequences of deep-sea activities. The ISA also has the authority to approve exploration contracts as long as the goals of these missions are in accordance with the ""common heritage of mankind"" principle. Over the years, the ISA has approved several of these contracts. Consequently, certain rich states and private stakeholders have lobbied and pushed for contracts and legislation that advantages them to the detriment of poorer states from the global south.
These aspects resulted in the process of legislating deep-sea mining activities becoming a challenging endeavour for the ISA. Over the last few decades, the ISA drafted regulation for exploring and prospecting deep-sea resources. These measures have generally been referred to as Exploration Regulations. On the basis of these regulations, the ISA has granted several exploration contracts to states and private actors. When it comes to the exploitation of the resources found in the seabed, since 2011 the ISA has been unsuccessfully trying to develop a concrete regulatory framework. The authority has prepared a draft of potential rules and regulations, provisionally named Draft Exploitation Regulations, which has yet to be approved in a final form. At the same time, the most recent version was published in 2019. The draft deals primarily with environmental concerns in regard to deep-sea mining and the measures and conditions that aspiring contractors need to fulfil in order to protect the marine ecosystem. The draft further underlines the common heritage of mankind principle and that deep-sea resources be mined in an equitable manner.
The most recent significant event for legislating deep-sea mining activities was the 1st part of the 28th annual session of the International Seabed Authority between the 16th and 31 March 2023 at the ISA's headquarters in Kingston, Jamaica. The meeting was inconclusive in coming up with concrete regulations and failed to adopt the Draft Exploitations Regulations in a final form. This fact puts further pressure on the ISA, as the 2-year rule's deadline is July 2023, and experts fear that the authority will be unable to adopt legislation in time. The 2nd part of the 28th annual session of the ISA will take part between the 10th and 21 July 2023.

Nauru's justification for triggering the 2-year rule
The government of Nauru stated that Nauru has proudly taken a leading role in developing the international legal framework governing seafloor nodules in the international seabed area (the Area). The authorities further stated that the Draft Exploitation Regulations have been in development for a long time, and are ready to be adopted in a final form.

Menar Wetland,"Menar Wetland is a freshwater wetland complex located in and around the village of Menar in Udaipur district, Rajasthan, India. It consists primarily of two lakes—Brahma Talab and Dhand Talab—which together support rich avifauna, especially during the winter migration season. It was designed as a Ramsar site on 4 June 2025.

Overview
Located about 45 km east of Udaipur, the wetland complex lies in a semi-arid zone and is sustained mainly by monsoon rainfall. The wetlands are seasonal but retain water long enough to serve as an important habitat for migratory and resident waterbirds.

Avifauna
Menar Wetland hosts over 180 species of birds annually, including several globally important migratory species.

Bar-headed goose (Anser indicus)
Greater flamingo (Phoenicopterus roseus)
Painted stork (Mycteria leucocephala)
Common teal, Northern shoveler, and other ducks
White-tailed lapwing (Vanellus leucurus)
Black-necked Stork (Ephippiorhynchus asiaticus)
The area has been recognized as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) and the Rajasthan Forest Department in 2024.

Community conservation
Menar is widely regarded as a successful example of community-led wetland conservation. Local villagers have actively protected the area since the 2010s, banning hunting and collaborating with the Forest Department to monitor and conserve bird populations. The village was declared a ""Bird Village"" by the Rajasthan government in 2021.
Annual bird festivals and awareness programs have been organized in collaboration with NGOs and government agencies to promote eco-tourism and environmental education.

Recognition
In 2024, the site was officially designated as an IBA. Efforts were made to nominate Menar Wetland for recognition as a Ramsar site under the Ramsar Convention, which would provide international protection and conservation funding. It was recognised as Ramsar wetland site on 4 June 2025.

Tourism
The wetland attracts birdwatchers and nature photographers between November and February. Basic eco-tourism infrastructure—including birdwatching towers and guided village walks—has been developed by local stakeholders with minimal ecological disturbance.

Lake monster,"A lake monster is a lake-dwelling creature in myth and folklore. The most famous example is the Loch Ness Monster. Depictions of lake monsters are often similar to those of sea monsters.
In the Motif-Index of Folk-Literature, entities classified as ""lake monsters"", such as the Scottish Loch Ness Monster, the American Chessie, and the Swedish Storsjöodjuret fall under B11.3.1.1. (""dragon lives in lake"").

Theories
According to the Swedish naturalist and author Bengt Sjögren (1980), present-day lake monsters are variations of older legends of water kelpies. Sjögren claims that the accounts of lake-monsters have changed during history, as do others. Older reports often talk about horse-like appearances, but more modern reports often have more reptile and dinosaur-like appearances; he concludes that the legendary kelpies have evolved into the present day saurian lake-monsters since the discovery of dinosaurs and giant aquatic reptiles and the popularization of them in both scientific and fictional writings and art.
The stories cut across cultures, existing in some variation in many countries. and have undergone what Michel Meurger calls concretizing (The process of turning items, drawings, general beliefs and stories into a plausible whole) and naturalization over time as humanity's view of the world has changed.
In many of these areas, especially around Loch Ness, Lake Champlain and the Okanagan Valley, these lake monsters have become important tourist draws.
In Ben Radford and Joe Nickell's book Lake Monster Mysteries, the authors attribute a vast number of sightings to otter misidentifications. Ed Grabianowski plotted the distribution of North American lake monster sightings and then overlaid this with the distribution of the common otter and found a near perfect match. It turns out that three or four otters swimming in a line look remarkably like a serpentine, humped creature undulating through the water, very easy to mistake for a single creature if you see them from a distance. ""This isn't speculation. I'm not making this up,"" Nickell said. ""I've spoken to people who saw what they thought was a lake monster, got closer and discovered it was actually a line of otters. That really happens."" Of course, not every supposed lake monster sighting can be attributed to otters, but it is an excellent example of how our perceptions can be fooled.
Paul Barrett and Darren Naish note that the existence of any large animals in isolation (i.e., in a situation where no breeding population exists) is highly unlikely. Naish also observes that the stories are likely remnants of tales meant to keep children safely away from the water.
There have been many purported sightings of lake monsters, and even some photographs, but each time these have either been shown to be deliberate deceptions, such as the Lake George Monster Hoax, or serious doubts about the veracity and verifiability have arisen, as with the famous Mansi photograph of Champ.

The most recent lake monster sighting to get widespread attention occurred during post-production of the Champ movie Lucy and the Lake Monster. The filmmakers reviewed their drone footage from production on August 2, 2024, and noticed what appears to be a large creature swimming just below the surface of the water, in Bulwagga Bay.  The alleged plesiosaur image is visible in the bottom right portion of the screen, swimming behind a boat containing the two lead actors in the film. The boat was 142 inches from the tip of the bow to the stern and 50.5 inches at the widest point and the alleged plesiosaur appears bigger than the boat. One of the co-writers, Kelly Tabor, believes it to be a foundational piece of evidence for Champ.  The second co-writer, Richard Rossi, referred to himself as the ""Doubting Thomas,"" and he shared the entire five minutes of footage with a conclave of scientists with earned doctorates in science for further study of the Tabor-Rossi footage.

Missile lofting,"Lofting is a trajectory optimization technique used in some missile systems to extend range and improve target engagement effectiveness, usually in beyond-visual range scenarios.

Method
Lofting involves a missile ascending to a higher altitude after launch, creating a parabolic arc similar to Ballistic Missiles, before descending toward its target. This elevated flight path allows the missile to capitalize on reduced air resistance at higher altitudes, increasing both the missile's potential energy and the kinetic energy during terminal guidance, thus enabling greater range and Probability of kill. 
Lofting typically occurs at altitudes ranging from 20,000 to 50,000ft, but can range up to 400km when used as a ballistic trajectory.

Advantages
Lofting offers several distinct advantages compared to sea-skimming and direct-intercept trajectories, particularly in beyond-visual-range engagements.
Unlike sea-skimming, which prioritizes low-altitude flight to avoid radar detection but suffers from increased drag and limited range, lofting allows the missile to ascend to higher altitudes where air resistance is lower. This reduced drag enables greater range and energy efficiency, allowing the missile to retain more kinetic energy for terminal guidance and target interception. 
Compared to direct-intercept trajectories, lofting also improves engagement flexibility by providing a steeper attack angle, which is particularly effective against maneuvering or high-altitude targets.

Disadvantages
In comparison to sea-skimming trajectories, lofting lacks radar-avoidance characteristics, making it susceptible to detection by its target and potential interceptors.
Lofting is also more mathematically and technologically complex in comparison to direct-interception, and is only viable in long-range engagements.
Additionally, the thinner air which lofting utilizes to reduce drag and increase range carries the downside of impeding the ability for control surfaces to maneuver the missile. This can reduce a missile's ability to adjust for fast-moving or maneuvering targets, however can be circumvented with the use of thrust vectoring - at the downside of added cost and complexity.

Use in Missiles
A number of missiles are known or speculated to utilize lofting techniques, such as: 

AIM-120 AMRAAM - United States 
AIM-54 Phoenix - United States 
AIM-260 JATM - United States
Meteor - France, Sweden, United Kingdom, Germany
R-77 - Russia
PL-15 - China

Drainage system (geomorphology),"In geomorphology, drainage systems, also known as river systems, are the patterns formed by the streams, rivers, and lakes in a particular drainage basin. They are governed by the topography of land, whether a particular region is dominated by hard or soft rocks, and the gradient of the land. Geomorphologists and hydrologists often view streams as part of drainage basins (and sub-basins). This is the topographic region from which a stream receives runoff, throughflow, and its saturated equivalent, groundwater flow. The number, size, and shape of the drainage basins varies and the larger and more detailed the topographic map, the more information is available.

Drainage patterns
Per the lie of channels, drainage systems can fall into one of several categories, known as drainage patterns. These depend on the topography and geology of the land.
All forms of transitions can occur between parallel, dendritic, and trellis patterns.

Accordant versus discordant drainage patterns
A drainage system is described as accordant if its pattern correlates to the structure and relief of the landscape over which it flows.
A discordant system or pattern does not correlate to the topography and geology of the area. Discordant drainage patterns are classified into two main types: antecedent and superimposed, while ante position drainage patterns combine the two. In antecedent drainage, a river's vertical incision ability matches that of land uplift due to tectonic forces. Superimposed drainage develops differently: initially, a drainage system develops on a surface composed of 'younger' rocks, but due to denudation activities this surface of younger rocks is removed and the river continues to flow over a seemingly new surface, but one in fact made up of rocks of old geological formation.

Dendritic drainage pattern
Dendritic drainage systems (from Greek δενδρίτης, dendrites, ""of or like a tree"") are not straight and are the most common form of the drainage system. In this, there are many sub-tributaries (analogous to the twigs of a tree), which merge into tributaries of the main river (the branches and the trunk of the tree, respectively). They are seen to feed a river channel that matches and is strongly accordant to the overriding gradient of the land. Truly dendritic systems form in V-shaped valleys; as a result, the rock types must be impervious and non-porous.

Parallel drainage pattern
A parallel drainage system occurs on elongate landforms like outcropping resistant rock bands), typically following natural faults or erosion (such as prevailing wind scars). The watercourses run swift and straight, with very few tributaries, and all flow in the same direction. This system forms on very long, uniform slopes, for instance, high rivers flowing southeast from the Aberdare Mountains in Kenya and many rivers of Myanmar.
This sometimes indicates a major fault that cuts across an area of steeply folded bedrock.

Trellis drainage pattern
The geometry of a trellis drainage system is similar to that of a common garden trellis. Along a strike valley, smaller tributaries feed into the steep slopes of mountainsides. These tributaries enter the main river about perpendicular, causing a trellis-like appearance of the system. They form where hard and soft formations exist on both banks of the main river, and are reflective of height, accentuated by erosion. Trellis drainage is characteristic of folded mountains, such as the Appalachian Mountains in North America and in the north part of Trinidad.

Rectangular drainage pattern
Rectangular drainage develops on rocks that are of approximately uniform resistance to erosion, but which have two directions of jointing at approximately right angles or 90 degrees. The joints are usually less resistant to erosion than the bulk rock so erosion tends to preferentially open the joints and streams eventually develop along the joints. The result is a stream system in which streams consist mainly of straight line segments with right-angle bends and tributaries join larger streams at right angles. This pattern can be found with the Arun River in Nepal.

Radial drainage pattern
In a radial drainage system, the streams radiate outwards from a central high point. Volcanos usually have archetypal features on which this commonly develops are modest or hard domes  pattern develops when streams flow in many general directions (meaning quite long-term)
In India, the Amarkantak range and Ramgarh crater are most archetypal; and Dogu'a Tembien in Ethiopia.

Centripetal drainage pattern
When the streams converge at a point, which is generally a depression or a basin they form centripetal or inland drainage pattern.

Deranged drainage pattern
A deranged drainage system is a drainage system in drainage basins where there is no coherent pattern to the rivers and lakes. These can form in areas with extensive limestone deposits, where surface streams can disappear into the groundwater via caves and subterranean drainage r",Rivers,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage_system_(geomorphology),1,geomorphology drainage system also known river system pattern formed stream river lake particular drainage basin governed topography land whether particular region dominated hard soft rock gradient land geomorphologists hydrologist often view stream part drainage basin subbasins topographic region stream receives runoff throughflow saturated equivalent groundwater flow number size shape drainage basin varies larger detailed topographic map information available drainage pattern per lie channel drainage system fall one several category known drainage pattern depend topography geology land form transition occur parallel dendritic trellis pattern accordant versus discordant drainage pattern drainage system described accordant pattern correlate structure relief landscape flow discordant system pattern correlate topography geology area discordant drainage pattern classified two main type antecedent superimposed ante position drainage pattern combine two antecedent drainage river vertical incision ability match land uplift due tectonic force superimposed drainage develops differently initially drainage system develops surface composed younger rock due denudation activity surface younger rock removed river continues flow seemingly new surface one fact made rock old geological formation dendritic drainage pattern dendritic drainage system greek δενδρίτης dendrite like tree straight common form drainage system many subtributaries analogous twig tree merge tributary main river branch trunk tree respectively seen feed river channel match strongly accordant overriding gradient land truly dendritic system form vshaped valley result rock type must impervious nonporous parallel drainage pattern parallel drainage system occurs elongate landforms like outcropping resistant rock band typically following natural fault erosion prevailing wind scar watercourse run swift straight tributary flow direction system form long uniform slope instance high river flowing southeast aberdare mountain kenya many river myanmar sometimes indicates major fault cut across area steeply folded bedrock trellis drainage pattern geometry trellis drainage system similar common garden trellis along strike valley smaller tributary feed steep slope mountainside tributary enter main river perpendicular causing trellislike appearance system form hard soft formation exist bank main river reflective height accentuated erosion trellis drainage characteristic folded mountain appalachian mountain north america north part trinidad rectangular drainage pattern rectangular drainage develops rock approximately uniform resistance erosion two direction jointing approximately right angle degree joint usually less resistant erosion bulk rock erosion tends preferentially open joint stream eventually develop along joint result stream system stream consist mainly straight line segment rightangle bend tributary join larger stream right angle pattern found arun river nepal radial drainage pattern radial drainage system stream radiate outwards central high point volcano usually archetypal feature commonly develops modest hard dome pattern develops stream flow many general direction meaning quite longterm india amarkantak range ramgarh crater archetypal dogua tembien ethiopia centripetal drainage pattern stream converge point generally depression basin form centripetal inland drainage pattern deranged drainage pattern deranged drainage system drainage system drainage basin coherent pattern river lake form area extensive limestone deposit surface stream disappear groundwater via cave subterranean drainage r
Yellow dune,"Yellow dunes are sand dunes that develop after the first set of embryo dunes appear. They have an average depth of about 5m and are composed primarily of sand. They are so named because their lack of humus gives them a yellow color.
The percentage of exposed sand on these dunes is generally about 20%. The remaining 80% is covered with vegetation that cannot withstand the conditions on the embryo dunes. The plants on these dunes can withstand the slightly alkaline sand an example of the plants would be marram grass spinifex. 
The moisture content of these dunes is relatively low so the plants still have very strong root structure and are capable of getting every drop of water that comes their way.
As this dune develops, a new embryo dune will form in front.

Gilgai,"A gilgai is a small, ephemeral lake formed from a surface depression in expanding clay soils. Gilgai is also used to refer to the overall micro-relief in such areas, consisting of mounds and depressions. The name comes from an Australian Aboriginal word meaning small water hole. The pools are commonly a few metres across and less than 30 cm (12 in) deep but, in some instances, they may be several metres deep and up to 100 m (330 ft) across. Gilgais are found worldwide wherever there are cracking clay soils and marked wet and dry seasons. Gilgais are also called melonholes, crabholes, hogwallows, or puff and shelf formations.

Formation
Gilgais are thought to form in vertisols through repeated cycles of swelling when wet and subsequent shrinkage upon drying. That action, known as argillipedoturbation, causes the soil to crack when dry, allowing loose soil material to fill the cracks. When the soil swells upon subsequent re-wetting, the soil pressure cannot be dispersed into the now-full cracks and the soil is forced sideways causing a mound to form between cracks and a depression to form at the location of the crack. That process is then exaggerated as the depressions hold water and thus become wetter and swell more than the mounds, causing even greater shrinkage and cracking. In addition, the cracks channel water deeply into the soil, causing even greater swelling and subsequent cracking of the depression areas. Each cycle of swelling, shrinkage and cracking becomes more exaggerated and the landscape eventually becomes covered by a repeated pattern of mounds and depressions. The depressions hold surface water during wet seasons.

Distribution
Australia has an abundance of cracking clay soils and large areas dominated by pronounced wet and dry seasons, providing ideal circumstances for gilgais to form. Central Russia and several parts of the United States, including South Dakota, Mississippi, and Texas also host the formations. Gilgais are structurally similar to the patterned ground of frigid regions, but periglacial soil polygons are formed instead, by repeated freeze-thaw cycles.

Relation to humans
Gilgais were an important water source for Indigenous Australians, enabling them to forage over areas that lacked permanent water. Similarly, they allowed the stock of early Australian pastoralists to graze those areas. The introduction of wells and pumps reduced the value of gilgais to humans as a source of water. Many farmers now generally regard them as a nuisance. The movement of soil associated with gilgai formation damages infrastructure, including building foundations, roads and railway lines, and the undulations interfere with crop harvesting. The presence of seasonal water in grazing land makes it more difficult to control stock and provides a water supply for feral animals and kangaroos.
Gilgais remain of great ecological significance as a source of water for animal and plant life. Crayfish burrow in the wet basins and ants build up the mounds, magnifying the formations through bioturbation.

Unsinkable aircraft carrier,"An unsinkable aircraft carrier is a geographically or politically important island that is used to extend the power projection of a military force. Because such an entity is capable of acting as an airbase and is a physical landmass not easily destroyed, it is, in effect, an immobile aircraft carrier that cannot be sunk.
The term unsinkable aircraft carrier first appeared during World War II, to describe the islands and atolls in the Pacific Ocean that became strategically important as potential airstrips for American bombers in their transoceanic war against Japan. To this end, the US military engaged in numerous island hopping operations to oust the occupying Japanese forces from such islands; the US Navy Seabees would often have to subsequently construct airstrips there from scratch—sometimes over entire atolls—quickly, in order to support air operations against Japan.
Midway Atoll has been described as a fourth, unsinkable, American aircraft carrier at the Battle of Midway in 1942 (the Americans had three conventional carriers). It did indeed function this way in the battle, with aircraft from the atoll attacking Japanese carriers and the atoll being attacked in turn.
Malta and Iceland were sometimes described as unsinkable aircraft carriers during World War II, making Malta a target of the Axis powers.
During the Korean War (1950-1953) United States General Douglas MacArthur described Taiwan as an unsinkable aircraft carrier.: 164  People's Republic of China normalized relations in the 1970s and the United States annulled the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty with Taiwan. However, the United States has de facto maintained the status quo through the Taiwan Relations Act. 
The US military is also said to have considered the British Isles as unsinkable aircraft carriers during the Cold War. In 1983, Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone pledged to make Japan an ""unsinkable aircraft carrier in the Pacific"", assisting the US in defending against the threat of Soviet bombers. US Secretary of State General Alexander Haig described Israel as ""the largest American aircraft carrier in the world that cannot be sunk"". In arguing against production of the CVA-01 aircraft carriers, the Royal Air Force claimed that Australia could serve adequately in the same role, using false maps that placed Singapore 400 miles (640 km) closer to Australia. The island of Cyprus is also often described as an unsinkable aircraft carrier, in relation to the military presence of the United Kingdom there.
During the Second World War, the United Kingdom gave some serious thought to building virtually unsinkable aircraft carriers from ice reinforced with sawdust (Project Habakkuk). A model was made, and serious consideration was given to the project, with a design displacing 2.2 million tons and accommodating 150 twin-engined bombers on the drawing board, but it was never produced.

Shockwave cosmology,"Shockwave cosmology is a non-standard cosmology proposed by Joel Smoller and Blake Temple in 2003. In this model, the “big bang” is an explosion inside a black hole, producing the expanding volume of space and matter that includes the observable universe.

Integration with general relativity
Smoller and Temple integrate shock waves into Einstein's general relativity. This produces a universe that ""looks essentially identical to the aftermath of the big bang"" according to cosmologists Barnes and Lewis. They explain that Smoller and Temple's version is distinguished from the big bang only by there being a shockwave at the leading edge of an explosion – one that, for Smoller and Temple's model, must be beyond the observable universe. However, Barnes and Lewis do not support shockwave cosmology because they see it as not testable; they point out that there is no explosion in the standard theory of the Big Bang.

Current and future state of the universe
From Smoller and Temple's calculations, we are still inside an expanding black hole. The configuration of 'flat' spacetime (see Minkowski space) inside a black hole, also occurs during the moments of the formation of a black hole from a collapsing star.
Eventually, according to shockwave cosmology, the mass of our expanding volume of space and matter will fall in density as it expands. At some point, the event horizon of the black hole will cease to be. An outside observer will then see it appear as a white hole. The matter would then continue to expand.

Alternative to dark energy
In related work, Smoller, Temple, and Vogler propose that this shockwave may have resulted in our part of the universe having a lower density than that surrounding it, causing the accelerated expansion normally attributed to dark energy.  
They also propose that this related theory could be tested: a universe with dark energy should give a figure for the cubic correction to redshift versus luminosity C = −0.180 at a = a whereas for Smoller, Temple, and Vogler's alternative C should be positive rather than negative. They give a more precise calculation for their wave model alternative as: the cubic correction to redshift versus luminosity at a = a is C = 0.359.

Comparison with standard cosmology
Although shockwave cosmology produces a universe that ""looks essentially identical to the aftermath of the big bang"", cosmologists consider that it needs further development before it could be considered as a more advantageous model than the big bang theory (or standard model) in explaining the universe. In particular, and especially for the proposed alternative to dark energy, it would need to explain big bang nucleosynthesis, the quantitative details of the microwave background anisotropies, the Lyman-alpha forest, and galaxy surveys.

Aquapelago,"An aquapelago is an assemblage of marine and terrestrial elements in which the aquatic spaces are key to community livelihoods and to communities’ senses of identity and belonging. Aquapelago refers to the socially constructed spaces of island, coastal, lacustrine or riverine locations, where humans have developed particularly concentrated engagements with the marine environment for their livelihoods (such as fishing or gathering aquatic plants) or leisure (such as surfing or diving). A neologism, aquapelago denotes the manner in which environmental psychology has been key to various maritime communities and causes in recent years. For example, the famous Mabo decision on indigenous Australian native title in 1992, successfully argued that areas of the seabed, and the aquatic resources above them, were part of traditional Torres Strait Islander community territories and related senses of communal homelands.

Concept and etymology
The term aquapelago was introduced in 2012 in Shima online journal of research into island and maritime cultures. The term subsequently gained momentum in geography, anthropology, and cultural studies, since it addresses a conceptual and lexical gap in topical discourse on the human relationship to nature. More recently, the concept has extended in reach to creative fields such as theatre, science fiction, and music.
In its initial coinage, etymologically, the term replaces the initial two syllables of the well-known term archipelago with aqua in order to reassert the role of marine elements in aggregations of islands that has been largely lost from contemporary usage of archipelago. The concept has been further elaborated, linking it to livelihood activities and to the Japanese concept of shima (referring to islands and related distinct cultural landscapes). This concept is striking in that it conceives of combined terrestrial and aquatic spaces as, effectively, neighborhoods.
The concept of aquapelago has been envisaged as a reflection on the Anthropocene and as:

Subsequent developments of the concept have analysed its applicability to topics such as ocean spaces and national rights of access to these, cultural practices in Melanesian coastal societies and career making in island communities. The original analyses of the aquapelago have been further expanded by addressing metropolitan locales and providing a characterisation of Manhattan as an aquapelagic city that was subsequently critiqued and modified. While there have been critics of the concept, some who regard the term as unnecessary in that archipelagic analyses can be extended to address aquatic elements, writers from various disciplines have engaged with the concept in a positive manner, such as an exploration of the concept with regard to water ecology themed performance works in the journal Women’s Studies Quarterly and a discussion of a geopolitical aesthetic of the subterranean in the journal Geopolitics. Further, the lens of the aquapelago can act as a bridge between the fields of island studies and studies examining seasteading.

Associated concepts
One significant development of the concept of the aquapelago has concerned the notion of there being an “aquapelagic imaginary).” This concept has been subsequently elaborated in a theme issue of the journal Shima on mermaids, mer-cultures and the aquapelagic imaginary to refer to the manner in which communities’ “engagements with their aquapelagic locales” in folk-/media-loric contexts can be understood to reflect upon and transcend “perceptions of the limits of human presence in and experience of aquatic spaces.” In an article analysing the creation of a modern mythic entity, the Ningen, a creature rumoured to inhabit the southern Pacific Ocean, there is a discussion about the aquapelagic imaginary as a “subset"" of the ""social imaginary”, which can be regarded as a historically determined “enabling but not fully explicable symbolic matrix within which a people imagine and act as world-making collective agents”.

Braided river,"A braided river (also called braided channel or braided stream) consists of a network of river channels separated by small, often temporary, islands called braid bars or, in British English usage, aits or eyots.
Braided streams tend to occur in rivers with high sediment loads or coarse grain sizes, and in rivers with steeper slopes than typical rivers with straight or meandering channel patterns. They are also associated with rivers with rapid and frequent variation in the amount of water they carry, i.e., with ""flashy"" rivers, and with rivers with weak banks.
Braided channels are found in a variety of environments all over the world, including gravelly mountain streams, sand bed rivers, on alluvial fans, on river deltas, and across depositional plains.

Description
A braided river consists of a network of multiple shallow channels that diverge and rejoin around ephemeral braid bars. This gives the river a fancied resemblance to the interwoven strands of a braid. The braid bars, also known as channel bars, branch islands, or accreting islands, are usually unstable and may be completely covered at times of high water. The channels and braid bars are usually highly mobile, with the river layout often changing significantly during flood events. When the islets separating channels are stabilized by vegetation, so that they are more permanent features, they are sometimes called aits or eyots.
A braided river differs from a meandering river, which has a single sinuous channel. It is also distinct from an anastomosing river, which consist of multiple interweaving semi-permanent channels which are separated by floodplain rather than channel bars; these channels may themselves be braided.

Formation
The physical processes that determine whether a river will be braided or meandering are not fully understood. However, there is wide agreement that a river becomes braided when it carries an abundant supply of sediments.
Experiments with flumes suggest that a river becomes braided when a threshold level of sediment load or slope is reached. On timescales long enough for the river to evolve, a sustained increase in sediment load will increase the bed slope of the river, so that a variation of slope is equivalent to a variation in sediment load, provided the amount of water carried by the river is unchanged. A threshold slope was experimentally determined to be 0.016 (ft/ft) for a 0.15 cu ft/s (0.0042 m3/s) stream with poorly sorted coarse sand. Any slope over this threshold created a braided stream, while any slope under the threshold created a meandering stream or – for very low slopes – a straight channel. Also important to channel development is the proportion of suspended load sediment to bed load. An increase in suspended sediment allowed for the deposition of fine erosion-resistant material on the inside of a curve, which accentuated the curve and in some instances, caused a river to shift from a braided to a meandering profile.
These experimental results were expressed in formulas relating the critical slope for braiding to the discharge and grain size. The higher the discharge, the lower the critical slope, while larger grain size yields a higher critical slope. However, these give only an incomplete picture, and numerical simulations have become increasingly important for understanding braided rivers.
Aggradation (net deposition of sediments) favors braided rivers, but is not essential. For example, the Rakaia and Waitaki Rivers of New Zealand are not aggrading, due to retreating shorelines, but are nonetheless braided rivers. Variable discharge has also been identified as important in braided rivers, but this may be primarily due to the tendency for frequent floods to reduce bank vegetation and destabilize the banks, rather than because variable discharge is an essential part of braided river formation.
Numerical models suggest that bedload transport (movement of sediment particles by rolling or bouncing along the river bottom) is essential to formation of braided rivers, with net erosion of sediments at channel divergences and net deposition at convergences. Braiding is reliably reproduced in simulations whenever there is little lateral constraint on flow and there is significant bedload transport. Braiding is not observed in simulations of the extreme cases of pure scour (no deposition taking place), which produces a dendritic system, or of cohesive sediments with no bedload transport. Meanders fully develop only when the river banks are sufficiently stabilized to limit lateral flow. An increase in suspended sediment relative to bedload allows the deposition of fine erosion-resistant material on the inside of a curve, which accentuated the curve and in some instances, causes a river to shift from a braided to a meandering profile. A stream with cohesive banks that are resistant to erosion will form narrow, deep, meandering channels, whereas a stream with highly erodible banks will form wide, shallow channels, ",Rivers,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braided_river,1,braided river also called braided channel braided stream consists network river channel separated small often temporary island called braid bar british english usage aits eyots braided stream tend occur river high sediment load coarse grain size river steeper slope typical river straight meandering channel pattern also associated river rapid frequent variation amount water carry ie flashy river river weak bank braided channel found variety environment world including gravelly mountain stream sand bed river alluvial fan river delta across depositional plain description braided river consists network multiple shallow channel diverge rejoin around ephemeral braid bar give river fancied resemblance interwoven strand braid braid bar also known channel bar branch island accreting island usually unstable may completely covered time high water channel braid bar usually highly mobile river layout often changing significantly flood event islet separating channel stabilized vegetation permanent feature sometimes called aits eyots braided river differs meandering river single sinuous channel also distinct anastomosing river consist multiple interweaving semipermanent channel separated floodplain rather channel bar channel may braided formation physical process determine whether river braided meandering fully understood however wide agreement river becomes braided carry abundant supply sediment experiment flume suggest river becomes braided threshold level sediment load slope reached timescales long enough river evolve sustained increase sediment load increase bed slope river variation slope equivalent variation sediment load provided amount water carried river unchanged threshold slope experimentally determined ftft cu ft m stream poorly sorted coarse sand slope threshold created braided stream slope threshold created meandering stream – low slope – straight channel also important channel development proportion suspended load sediment bed load increase suspended sediment allowed deposition fine erosionresistant material inside curve accentuated curve instance caused river shift braided meandering profile experimental result expressed formula relating critical slope braiding discharge grain size higher discharge lower critical slope larger grain size yield higher critical slope however give incomplete picture numerical simulation become increasingly important understanding braided river aggradation net deposition sediment favor braided river essential example rakaia waitaki river new zealand aggrading due retreating shoreline nonetheless braided river variable discharge also identified important braided river may primarily due tendency frequent flood reduce bank vegetation destabilize bank rather variable discharge essential part braided river formation numerical model suggest bedload transport movement sediment particle rolling bouncing along river bottom essential formation braided river net erosion sediment channel divergence net deposition convergence braiding reliably reproduced simulation whenever little lateral constraint flow significant bedload transport braiding observed simulation extreme case pure scour deposition taking place produce dendritic system cohesive sediment bedload transport meander fully develop river bank sufficiently stabilized limit lateral flow increase suspended sediment relative bedload allows deposition fine erosionresistant material inside curve accentuated curve instance cause river shift braided meandering profile stream cohesive bank resistant erosion form narrow deep meandering channel whereas stream highly erodible bank form wide shallow channel
Criticism of Netflix,"Netflix is a subscription streaming service owned by the American company Netflix, Inc. Launched on August 29, 1997, it initially offered DVD rental and sale by mail, but the sales were eliminated within a year to focus on the DVD rental business. In 2007, the company began transitioning to its current subscription streaming model. Since its launch, the company was subject to numerous criticisms, the basis of which range from its business practices and workplace culture to issues with the service it provides, including content issues, lack of close captioning and pricing. This article provides an overview of key criticisms the company has faced.

Artistic concerns
Film creator concern with allowing users to change playback speed
In October 2019, Netflix began to experiment with allowing users to change the speed at which content is being played, ranging from half the original speed, to up to one-and-a-half times faster the original speed. The feature was deployed to selected users of the service's Android app. The feature was criticized by various members of the film industry, who argued that it harmed the artistic integrity of their work. Netflix vice president Keela Robison stated that the feature ""generated a fair amount of feedback – both for and against,"" and noted use cases for slowing down playback, such as helping viewers locate details in scenes, or making it easier to understand dialogue in foreign languages if they are still learning the language. Robison also noted that they had deliberately limited the rollout of the feature due to ""creator concerns,"" and that such functions had already been available on DVD players.

Showing copyrighted subtitles of Bicycle Thieves
In 2015, Netflix and Cinedigm were sued by Corinth Films over its streaming of the 1948 Italian film Bicycle Thieves; although the film itself was considered public domain in the United States, distinct subtitling or dubbing of the film can still be considered a separate and copyrightable work. Corinth alleged that the specific version of the film, registered by Richard Feiner & Co. and owned by Corinth, was being licensed by Cinedigm to Netflix without permission. The parties later settled.

Steven Spielberg, governor of the directive branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), has questioned the eligibility of Netflix's feature films for Academy Award nominations since films are released simultaneously in cinemas and via video on demand, in defiance of the standard three-month release window. While Netflix had previously given its theatrical acquisitions a simultaneous release in theaters and streaming, Roma was the first under a new policy to provide at least a three-week theatrical run before streaming release. According to the official rules of the Academy, a film only needs to be screened in the city of Los Angeles for seven days, with a minimum of three public showings per-day, to qualify for an Oscar nomination. However, the eligibility criteria do allow for simultaneous releases on non-theatrical platforms.
Spielberg complained that films ""that are just given token qualifications in a couple of theaters for less than a week"" shouldn't qualify. Following the 91st Academy Awards (during which Roma became the first film distributed by a streaming service to be nominated for Best Picture, and won Best Foreign Language Film and two other awards), a spokesperson for Spielberg's studio, Amblin Partners, stated that he ""feels strongly about the difference between the streaming and theatrical situation,"" and would address the issue at the Academy's next board of governors meeting in April 2019.
Critics argued that Roma had an unfair advantage, singling out the service's wide availability, refusal to report box office numbers, disrespect of the industry's standard release windows with only three weeks of exclusive theatrical play (although it is not uncommon for some nominees to only receive the week-long minimum run), and excessive marketing spend (with reports ranging between $25 and $50 million, although its Oscars marketing was rolled into Netflix's overall marketing budget, which should not be). Due to its contravention of the standard three-month windows used by all major distributors, national cinema chains have refused to carry Netflix's theatrical releases. Netflix defended its distribution model, arguing that it was devoted to ""[providing] access for people who can't always afford, or live in towns without, theaters. Letting everyone, everywhere enjoy releases at the same time. Giving filmmakers more ways to share art. These things are not mutually exclusive.""
The U.S. Department of Justice warned the Academy that attempts to change its rules to discriminate against Netflix and other streaming platforms could violate antitrust law, as the parent companies of the traditional major studios (in particular, AT&T and Disney) have been making investments into streaming service",Netflix,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Netflix,0,netflix subscription streaming service owned american company netflix inc launched august initially offered dvd rental sale mail sale eliminated within year focus dvd rental business company began transitioning current subscription streaming model since launch company subject numerous criticism basis range business practice workplace culture issue service provides including content issue lack close captioning pricing article provides overview key criticism company faced artistic concern film creator concern allowing user change playback speed october netflix began experiment allowing user change speed content played ranging half original speed oneandahalf time faster original speed feature deployed selected user service android app feature criticized various member film industry argued harmed artistic integrity work netflix vice president keela robison stated feature generated fair amount feedback – noted use case slowing playback helping viewer locate detail scene making easier understand dialogue foreign language still learning language robison also noted deliberately limited rollout feature due creator concern function already available dvd player showing copyrighted subtitle bicycle thief netflix cinedigm sued corinth film streaming italian film bicycle thief although film considered public domain united state distinct subtitling dubbing film still considered separate copyrightable work corinth alleged specific version film registered richard feiner co owned corinth licensed cinedigm netflix without permission party later settled eligibility academy award steven spielberg governor directive branch academy motion picture art science ampas questioned eligibility netflixs feature film academy award nomination since film released simultaneously cinema via video demand defiance standard threemonth release window netflix previously given theatrical acquisition simultaneous release theater streaming rom first new policy provide least threeweek theatrical run streaming release according official rule academy film need screened city los angeles seven day minimum three public showing perday qualify oscar nomination however eligibility criterion allow simultaneous release nontheatrical platform spielberg complained film given token qualification couple theater less week shouldnt qualify following st academy award rom became first film distributed streaming service nominated best picture best foreign language film two award spokesperson spielberg studio amblin partner stated feel strongly difference streaming theatrical situation would address issue academy next board governor meeting april critic argued rom unfair advantage singling service wide availability refusal report box office number disrespect industry standard release window three week exclusive theatrical play although uncommon nominee receive weeklong minimum run excessive marketing spend report ranging million although oscar marketing rolled netflixs overall marketing budget due contravention standard threemonth window used major distributor national cinema chain refused carry netflixs theatrical release netflix defended distribution model arguing devoted providing access people cant always afford live town without theater letting everyone everywhere enjoy release time giving filmmaker way share art thing mutually exclusive u department justice warned academy attempt change rule discriminate netflix streaming platform could violate antitrust law parent company traditional major studio particular att disney making investment streaming service

City of Character,"A City of character, or Character City is a city that complies with the principles described by the International Association of Character Cities (IACC).  The group encourages governments, government leaders, civic organizations and religious organizations to band together to establish a ""city"" or ""community"" of character.  This involves passing ordinances, recognizing those who practice good character.  The IACC provides media and resources for those who wish to establish a character city as well as template websites, legislation and documentation.
The group declares that it has over 171 declared ""character cit[ies]"" in the United States and 48 known internationally.

International Association of Character Cities
The International Association of Character Cities (IACC) was established in 1998 as a division of the Character Training Institute, a 501(c)(3) non-profit, tax-exempt organization based in Oklahoma City, OK. IACC was developed to facilitate city-wide efforts in advocating personal character development
. Funding for the program is primarily generated from the sale of materials and training.

Program
The City of Character program encourages cities to each month emphasize and focus on one of 49 character qualities, developed originally Tom Hill as an adaptation of character traits identified by Bill Gothard.  The program was further developed by and is now administered by the Character Training Institute. Some of the qualities taught include: Attentiveness, Dependability, Forgiveness, Gratefulness, Orderliness, Truthfulness, and Obedience. A full list of these character qualities can be found on the Character First! Web site.
The IACC and Character First! organizations produce character-based materials for various groups, including: Family, Business, Education (Elementary and High School), and Community. Character First! is not a religious program, but the materials can also be adapted for use in a religious setting.  According to Character Training Institute and IACC advocate, Dr. Joseph Ahne, the program does use religious symbols and is ""biblically based"".  Dr. Anhe states that “We use [ Character First! ], because we can’t take religion into schools and government. But it’s all based on the same thing.”  Implementation of the program varies from symbolic to more devoted adherence, but based upon its adoption of the program, one city Tagaytay, Philippines, even requires completion of the Character First! program in order to receive a marriage license.
The cost of the program varies based on the materials purchased and training conferences utilized in the implementation.  Reports indicate the materials are between $1,200 per annum  or as much as $8,305.

Criticism
Critics argue that the movement is a thinly veiled attempt to reduce the separation of church and state and an attempt to require conformity and obedience in society.  Additionally, critics eye the foundation and funding of the program by various evangelical leaders including those in the Dominionist movement.  Finally, the character traits emphasized by the program are criticized for over-emphasizing orderliness and obedience which critics find especially troubling when mixed with a political agenda with ""template"" legislation, some of which emphasizes enabling schools to purchase IACC character training materials.  The program is described by some to be ""purely motivational"" and thus difficult to measure in its ""intangible benefits"".

Mike Huckabee
The program has come into the public eye because of former Governor Mike Huckabee's warm regards about character cities in general during his unsuccessful attempt in 2008 to gain the Republican presidential nomination.  The IACC uses Huckabee's name in its ""How to build a Character City"" guide.  The IACC has been accused by Huckabee's aides and Arkansas officials, as far back as 1997, of overstating Huckabee's enthusiasm or involvement in the program.

Sarah Palin
Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska, also promoted cities of character in Alaska, while running for Vice President of the United States in the 2008 U.S. elections.  During her second term as mayor and after attending an April 2000 training seminar at Bill Gothard's Institute in Basic Life Principles, Palin obtained the designation of ""City of Character"" for her hometown of Wasilla, Alaska.

Chicxulub crater,"The Chicxulub crater is an impact crater buried underneath the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico. Its center is offshore, but the crater is named after the onshore community of Chicxulub Pueblo (not the larger coastal town of Chicxulub Puerto). It was formed slightly over 66 million years ago when an asteroid, about ten kilometers (six miles) in diameter, struck Earth. The crater is estimated to be 200 kilometers (120 miles) in diameter and 30 kilometers (19 miles) in depth. It is believed to be the second largest impact structure on Earth, and the only one whose peak ring is intact and directly accessible for scientific research.
The crater was discovered by Antonio Camargo and Glen Penfield, geophysicists who had been looking for petroleum in the Yucatán Peninsula during the late 1970s. Penfield was initially unable to obtain evidence that the geological feature was a crater and gave up his search. Later, through contact with Alan R. Hildebrand in 1990, Penfield obtained samples that suggested it was an impact feature. Evidence for the crater's impact origin includes shocked quartz, a gravity anomaly, and tektites in surrounding areas.
The date of the impact coincides with the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (commonly known as the K–Pg or K–T boundary). It is now widely accepted that the devastation and climate disruption resulting from the impact was the primary cause of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, a mass extinction of 75% of plant and animal species on Earth, including all non-avian dinosaurs.

Discovery
In the late 1970s, geologist Walter Alvarez and his father, Nobel Prize–winning scientist Luis Walter Alvarez, put forth their theory that the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction was caused by an impact event. The main evidence of such an impact was contained in a thin layer of clay present in the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (K–Pg boundary) in Gubbio, Italy. The Alvarezes and colleagues reported that it contained an abnormally high concentration of iridium, a chemical element rare on Earth but common in asteroids. Iridium levels in this layer were as much as 160 times above the background level. It was hypothesized that the iridium was spread into the atmosphere when the impactor was vaporized and settled across Earth's surface among other material thrown up by the impact, producing the layer of iridium-enriched clay. At the time, there was no consensus on what caused the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction and the boundary layer, with theories including a nearby supernova, climate change, or a geomagnetic reversal.: 1095  The Alvarezes' impact hypothesis was rejected by many paleontologists, who believed that the lack of fossils found close to the K–Pg boundary—the ""three-meter problem""—suggested a more gradual die-off of fossil species.
The Alvarezes, joined by Frank Asaro and Helen Michel from University of California, Berkeley, published their paper on the iridium anomaly in Science in June 1980. Almost simultaneously Jan Smit and Jan Hertogen published their iridium findings from Caravaca, Spain, in Nature in May 1980. These papers were followed by other reports of similar iridium spikes at the K–Pg boundary across the globe, and sparked wide interest in the cause of the K–Pg extinction; over 2,000 papers were published in the 1980s on the topic.: 82  There were no known impact craters that were the right age and size, spurring a search for a suitable candidate. Recognizing the scope of the work, Lee Hunt and Lee Silver organized a cross-discipline meeting in Snowbird, Utah, in 1981. Unknown to them, evidence of the crater they were looking for was being presented the same week, and would be largely missed by the scientific community.: 83–84 

In 1978, geophysicists Glen Penfield and Antonio Camargo were working for the Mexican state-owned oil company Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex) as part of an airborne magnetic survey of the Gulf of Mexico north of the Yucatán Peninsula.: 20–21  Penfield's job was to use geophysical data to scout possible locations for oil drilling. In the offshore magnetic data, Penfield noted anomalies whose depth he estimated and mapped. He then obtained onshore gravity data from the 1940s. When the gravity maps and magnetic anomalies were compared, Penfield described a shallow ""bullseye"", 180 km (110 mi) in diameter, appearing on the otherwise non-magnetic and uniform surroundings—clear evidence to him of an impact feature. A decade earlier, the same map had suggested a crater to contractor Robert Baltosser, but Pemex corporate policy prevented him from publicizing his conclusion.: 20 
Penfield presented his findings to Pemex, who rejected the crater theory, instead deferring to findings that ascribed the feature to volcanic activity. Pemex disallowed release of specific data, but let Penfield and Camargo present the results at the 1981 Society of Exploration Geophysicists conference. That year's conference was under-attended and their report attracted little attention, with ma",Oceans,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicxulub_crater,1,chicxulub crater impact crater buried underneath yucatán peninsula mexico center offshore crater named onshore community chicxulub pueblo larger coastal town chicxulub puerto formed slightly million year ago asteroid ten kilometer six mile diameter struck earth crater estimated kilometer mile diameter kilometer mile depth believed second largest impact structure earth one whose peak ring intact directly accessible scientific research crater discovered antonio camargo glen penfield geophysicist looking petroleum yucatán peninsula late penfield initially unable obtain evidence geological feature crater gave search later contact alan r hildebrand penfield obtained sample suggested impact feature evidence crater impact origin includes shocked quartz gravity anomaly tektite surrounding area date impact coincides cretaceous–paleogene boundary commonly known k–pg k–t boundary widely accepted devastation climate disruption resulting impact primary cause cretaceous–paleogene extinction event mass extinction plant animal specie earth including nonavian dinosaur discovery late geologist walter alvarez father nobel prize–winning scientist luis walter alvarez put forth theory cretaceous–paleogene extinction caused impact event main evidence impact contained thin layer clay present cretaceous–paleogene boundary k–pg boundary gubbio italy alvarezes colleague reported contained abnormally high concentration iridium chemical element rare earth common asteroid iridium level layer much time background level hypothesized iridium spread atmosphere impactor vaporized settled across earth surface among material thrown impact producing layer iridiumenriched clay time consensus caused cretaceous–paleogene extinction boundary layer theory including nearby supernova climate change geomagnetic reversal alvarezes impact hypothesis rejected many paleontologist believed lack fossil found close k–pg boundary—the threemeter problem—suggested gradual dieoff fossil specie alvarezes joined frank asaro helen michel university california berkeley published paper iridium anomaly science june almost simultaneously jan smit jan hertogen published iridium finding caravaca spain nature may paper followed report similar iridium spike k–pg boundary across globe sparked wide interest cause k–pg extinction paper published topic known impact crater right age size spurring search suitable candidate recognizing scope work lee hunt lee silver organized crossdiscipline meeting snowbird utah unknown evidence crater looking presented week would largely missed scientific community – geophysicist glen penfield antonio camargo working mexican stateowned oil company petróleos mexicano pemex part airborne magnetic survey gulf mexico north yucatán peninsula – penfields job use geophysical data scout possible location oil drilling offshore magnetic data penfield noted anomaly whose depth estimated mapped obtained onshore gravity data gravity map magnetic anomaly compared penfield described shallow bullseye km mi diameter appearing otherwise nonmagnetic uniform surroundings—clear evidence impact feature decade earlier map suggested crater contractor robert baltosser pemex corporate policy prevented publicizing conclusion penfield presented finding pemex rejected crater theory instead deferring finding ascribed feature volcanic activity pemex disallowed release specific data let penfield camargo present result society exploration geophysicist conference year conference underattended report attracted little attention
Discharge (hydrology),"In hydrology, discharge is the volumetric flow rate (volume per time, in units of m3/h or ft3/h) of a stream. It equals the product of average flow velocity (with dimension of length per time, in m/h or ft/h) and the cross-sectional area (in m2 or ft2). It includes any suspended solids (e.g. sediment), dissolved chemicals like CaCO3(aq), or biologic material (e.g. diatoms) in addition to the water itself. Terms may vary between disciplines. For example, a fluvial hydrologist studying natural river systems may define discharge as streamflow, whereas an engineer operating a reservoir system may equate it with outflow, contrasted with inflow.

Formulation
A discharge is a measure of the quantity of any fluid flow over unit time. The quantity may be either volume or mass. Thus the water discharge of a tap (faucet) can be measured with a measuring jug and a stopwatch. Here the discharge might be 1 litre per 15 seconds, equivalent to 67 ml/second or 4 litres/minute. This is an average measure. For measuring the discharge of a river we need a different method and the most common is the 'area-velocity' method. The area is the cross sectional area across a river and the average velocity across that section needs to be measured for a unit time, commonly a minute. Measurement of cross sectional area and average velocity, although simple in concept, are frequently non-trivial to determine.
The units that are typically used to express discharge in streams or rivers include m3/s (cubic meters per second), ft3/s (cubic feet per second or cfs) and/or acre-feet per day.
A commonly applied methodology for measuring, and estimating, the discharge of a river is based on a simplified form of the continuity equation.  The equation implies that for any incompressible fluid, such as liquid water, the discharge (Q) is equal to the product of the stream's cross-sectional area (A) and its mean velocity (

    {\displaystyle {\bar {u}}}
  
 is the average flow velocity ([LT−1]; m/s or ft/s)
For example, the average discharge of the Rhine river in Europe is 2,200 cubic metres per second (78,000 cu ft/s) or 190,000,000 cubic metres (150,000 acre⋅ft) per day.
Because of the difficulties of measurement, a stream gauge is often used at a fixed location on the stream or river.

 refers to a ""dominant discharge"" or ""channel-forming discharge"", which is typically the 1–2 year flood, though there is a large amount of scatter around this mean. This is the event that causes significant erosion and deposition and determines the channel morphology.

Hydrograph
Catchment discharge
The catchment of a river above a certain location is determined by the surface area of all land which drains toward the river from above that point.  The river's discharge at that location depends on the rainfall on the catchment or drainage area and the inflow or outflow of groundwater to or from the area, stream modifications such as dams and irrigation diversions, as well as evaporation and evapotranspiration from the area's land and plant surfaces. In storm hydrology, an important consideration is the stream's discharge hydrograph, a record of how the discharge varies over time after a precipitation event.  The stream rises to a peak flow after each precipitation event, then falls in a slow recession.  Because the peak flow also corresponds to the maximum water level reached during the event, it is of interest in flood studies.  Analysis of the relationship between precipitation intensity and duration and the response of the stream discharge are ",Rivers,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discharge_(hydrology),1,hydrology discharge volumetric flow rate volume per time unit mh fth stream equal product average flow velocity dimension length per time mh fth crosssectional area ft includes suspended solid eg sediment dissolved chemical like cacoaq biologic material eg diatom addition water term may vary discipline example fluvial hydrologist studying natural river system may define discharge streamflow whereas engineer operating reservoir system may equate outflow contrasted inflow formulation discharge measure quantity fluid flow unit time quantity may either volume mass thus water discharge tap faucet measured measuring jug stopwatch discharge might litre per second equivalent mlsecond litresminute average measure measuring discharge river need different method common areavelocity method area cross sectional area across river average velocity across section need measured unit time commonly minute measurement cross sectional area average velocity although simple concept frequently nontrivial determine unit typically used express discharge stream river include m cubic meter per second ft cubic foot per second cf andor acrefeet per day commonly applied methodology measuring estimating discharge river based simplified form continuity equation equation implies incompressible fluid liquid water discharge q equal product stream crosssectional area mean velocity u ¯ displaystyle bar u written q u ¯ displaystyle qabar u q displaystyle q discharge lt− m ft displaystyle crosssectional area portion channel occupied flow l ft u ¯ displaystyle bar u average flow velocity lt− m ft example average discharge rhine river europe cubic metre per second cu ft cubic metre acre⋅ft per day difficulty measurement stream gauge often used fixed location stream river empirical relationship empirically derived relationship channel width breadth b depth h velocity u b ∝ q displaystyle bpropto q h ∝ q displaystyle hpropto q u ∝ q displaystyle upropto q parameter q displaystyle q refers dominant discharge channelforming discharge typically – year flood though large amount scatter around mean event cause significant erosion deposition determines channel morphology hydrograph catchment discharge catchment river certain location determined surface area land drain toward river point river discharge location depends rainfall catchment drainage area inflow outflow groundwater area stream modification dam irrigation diversion well evaporation evapotranspiration area land plant surface storm hydrology important consideration stream discharge hydrograph record discharge varies time precipitation event stream rise peak flow precipitation event fall slow recession peak flow also corresponds maximum water level reached event interest flood study analysis relationship precipitation intensity duration response stream discharge
Statistical thinking,"Statistical thinking is a tool for process analysis of phenomena in relatively simple terms, while also providing a level of uncertainty surrounding it. It is worth nothing that ""statistical thinking"" is not the same as ""quantitative literacy"", although there is overlap in interpreting numbers and data visualizations.
Statistical thinking relates processes and statistics, and is based on the following principles:

All work occurs in a system of interconnected processes.
Variation exists in all processes
Understanding and reducing variation are keys to success.

History
W. Edwards Deming promoted the concepts of statistical thinking, using two powerful experiments:
1. The Red Bead experiment, in which workers are tasked with running a more or less random procedure, yet the lowest ""performing"" workers are fired. The experiment demonstrates how the natural variability in a process can dwarf the contribution of individual workers' talent.
2. The Funnel experiment, again demonstrating that natural variability in a process can loom larger than it ought to.
The take home message from the experiments is that before management adjusts a process—such as by firing seemingly underperforming employees, or by making physical changes to an apparatus—they should consider all sources of variation in the process that led to the performance outcome.
Nigel Marriott breaks down the evolution of statistical thinking.

Benchmarks
Statistical thinking is thought to help in different contexts, such as the courtroom, biology labs, and children growing up surrounded by data.
The American Statistical Association (ASA) has laid out what it means to be ""statistically educated"". Here is a subset of concepts for students to know, that:

data beat anecdotes
data is natural, predictable, and quantifiable
random sampling allows results of surveys and experiments to be extrapolated to the population
random assignment in comparative experiments allows cause-and-effect conclusions to be drawn
to know association is not causation
significance does not necessarily imply practical importance, especially for studies with large sample sizes
no statistically significant difference or relationship does not necessarily mean there is no difference or no relationship in the population, especially for studies with small sample sizes
Statistical thinking is a recognized method used as part of Six Sigma methodologies.

Budapest-Bamako,"The Budapest-Bamako or Great African Run is a charity car race in Europe and Africa, and the largest amateur rally in the world. It is a low-budget version of the Dakar Rally, and goes from Budapest, Hungary to Bamako, Mali through the Sahara. It passes through Hungary, Austria or Slovenia, Italy, France, Spain, Morocco, Mauritania and Mali. The Budapest-Bamako was inspired by the Paris-Dakar Rally. There are few entry restrictions: as long as a vehicle is street legal, it can join the event.

History
The event was the brainchild of Hungarian internet entrepreneur and former radio shock jock Andrew G. Szabo, who wanted to give rally fans an option to the more expensive and stricter Dakar rally. After first envisioning a direct drive through the Sahara in Tunisia, Libya, Niger, Burkina Faso, and Mali he opted for a safer and more scenic route around the Western rim of Africa.

2005
On 26 December 2005, forty-two teams lined up in Budapest's Hősök tere for the inaugural run of the Budapest-Bamako. Two weeks later all but two teams arrived in Bamako's Place des Heroes (both meaning Heroes' Square in English). In 2007, over a hundred teams entered the race. Only ten of them did not cross the finish line.

2008
In 2008, over 400 people in 160 vehicles entered the Great African Run. Among the more unusual vehicles were a 1961 Velorex, an Ikarus 435 articulated bus, an ice cream truck, a Dacia, a Wartburg and a Polish Fiat 126. The 2008 run started amid security fears a week after the cancellation of the Dakar Rally. Several French and Spanish teams dropped out of the Bamako citing fears of terror in Mauritania. The run was completed with few problems. The Mauritanian government assigned thousands of military and police officers to guard the event.
The touring category was lighter and simpler than in previous years. Teams in the touring category enjoyed events like the Annual Star Wars Theme Party on Planet Tatooine in Morocco, the Tropic of Cancer Party or the B2 Big Beach Party in Mauritania on a virgin beach, that has been named B2 Beach.

2009
In 2009, the racing and the touring categories were completely separated. The race featured a more demanding course. There were stricter time controls and more sophisticated geo-challenges.

2010
In 2010 edition of the rally was directed by four time Budapest-Bamako veterans, Andras Polgar and his brother Tamas. Less than 36 hours before the start, the Mauritanian and Mali stages were cancelled after the Hungarian Foreign Ministry warned the Polgars of potential terror threats in Mauritania. That year, the rally ended in Agadir. Despite the changes in the official finish line 41 teams and over 25 tons of aid arrived in Bamako without incident after on February 1, 2010.
After the 2010 run, the organization of the Budapest-Bamako reverted to the founder of the event with the promise of returning to Mali in 2011.

2011
The 2011 rally ended successfully after teams completed one of the hardest editions of the rally. For the first time in its history the rally travelled through Senegal. Only 125 of the 160 teams finished and only 18 of the 40 race category teams crossed the finish line.

2012
In 2012, the finish line was the capital Guinea-Bissau. For the first time in the history of the rally Bamako was not the end stage. Drivers had to travel through Senegal once again.

2013
Organizers moved the finish line to Guinea-Bissau after a politically uncertain year in Mali. Hungary's anti-terror agency urged organizers to cancel because of the threat of kidnappings. The 2013 rally ended without incident. Out of the 142 teams only 89 crossed the finish line.

2014
Days before the start of the 2014 edition, organizer Andrew G. Szabo announced that the 2015 run would be the last Budapest-Bamako. Amid the continuing political instability in Mali and Guinea-Bissau, the rally ended in The Gambia. The capital, Banjul hosted the finish line ceremonies. The 2014 rally ended without incident. Out of the 145 teams, 105 finished the race on time.

2015
Three months before the start of the 2015 edition the Ministry of Tourism in Mali ensured the Budapest-Bamako its continued supported in exchange for two more runs to Mali. Organizers announced that the rally will return to Bamako in 2016 and 2017 if the security climate permits. The 2015 rally started amid the West Africa Ebola crises of 2014/15. Even though Mali become Ebola free just days before the rally started, the 2015 edition saw a record number of cancellations. Several members of the Mali Government welcomed the rally on February 1, 2015 in Bamako. Out of the 124 departing teams 102 arrived in Mali. The event was held without incident. The competition was won by the Hungarian, Gumis Ember Team.

2016
Two months prior to the start, on Nov 20, 2015 Islamist militants took 170 people hostage in a hotel in Mali. This was a strong deterrent once again for participants to cancel their participation in the 2016 run.

Human Rights City,"A Human Rights City is a municipality that engages with human rights. There are other definitions of human rights city available which are more specific and look at the human rights city from a particular angle. One says that a Human Rights City is a municipality that refers explicitly to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights standards and/or law in their policies, statements, and programs. Another definition states that a Human Rights City is 'a city which is organised around norms and principles of human rights'. This sociological definition emphasises the Human Rights City as a process to which to a varying degree a variety of agents contribute: from activists, experts and academics to international organisations, state governments, and local authorities and officials. Also, this definition does not qualify human rights as international, based on the fact that cities sometimes articulate human rights in their own charters in ways that have no formal or immediate recognition in international law, and may anticipate their appropriation by international bodies and incorporation into international law. The author claims that this definition captures better the different ways in which cities engage with human rights and participate in their co-production, not simply as receivers but also agents of human rights.
Analysts have observed growing numbers of such cities since 2000. Human Rights Cities do not always identify themselves as such but they are often called Human Rights Cities based on the fact that they engage with human rights. Broadly speaking, Human Rights Cities emerged in the late 1990s from the global human rights movement as well as the municipal movement. They reflect efforts of both activist groups and local government officials to improve respect for human rights principles at the local or community level. Because of their focus on local contexts, Human Rights Cities tend to emphasize economic, social, and cultural rights as they affect the lives of residents of cities and other communities and their ability to enjoy civil and political human rights. The human rights city concept is also intertwined with other innovations in human rights practice arisen at the local level, such as the Right to the City.
Human rights advocates describe a Human Rights City as “One whose residents and local authorities, through learning about the relevance of human rights to their daily lives (guided by a steering committee), join in ongoing learning, discussions, systematic analysis and critical thinking at the community level, to pursue a creative exchange of ideas and the joint planning of actions to realize their economic, social, political, civil and cultural human rights.” Human rights cities were defined at the 2011 World Human Rights Cities Forum of Gwangju (South Korea) as ""both a local community and a socio-political process in a local context where human rights play a key role as fundamental values and guiding principles."" The European Charter for the Safeguarding of Human Rights in the City and the Global Charter-Agenda for Human Rights in the City also provided a relevant framework for various practices led different cities across the world.

History of the Human Rights Cities movement
The Human Rights City initiative is the result of long-standing efforts of popular groups to defend and promote human rights, and thus represents an aspect of global human rights struggles. It can also be seen as a consequence of increasing levels of decentralization and local autonomy across the world, which led to increasing levels of awareness and political initiative among local governments.

Origins: From the Right to the City to the People's Movement for Human Rights Learning
Contemporary human rights city initiatives grow directly from earlier organizing around rights claims in urban settings. The widespread nature of urban problems affecting people's everyday lives and survival have generated similar types of responses in places around the world, helping account for the simultaneous emergence and consolidation of popular claims to the ""right to the city"". According to David Harvey, “to invoke rights to the city means ‘to claim some kind of shaping power over the processes of urbanization, over the ways in which our cities are made and remade and to do so in a fundamental and radical way’.""
Ideas inspiring this movement first emerged in the 1970s, with many influenced by Henri Lefebvre's 1968 book, Le Droit à la ville. The movement has expanded and gained momentum around the world since the mid-1990s. The proliferation of financial crises, urban austerity, and environmental damage has contributed to the rise of a growing number of cities around the world that are referring more explicitly to international human rights in their policies, statements, and programs.
The formally named “Human Rights Cities” initiative was launched by the People's Movement for Human Rights Lear",Cities,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_City,1,human right city municipality engages human right definition human right city available specific look human right city particular angle one say human right city municipality refers explicitly universal declaration human right international human right standard andor law policy statement program another definition state human right city city organised around norm principle human right sociological definition emphasis human right city process varying degree variety agent contribute activist expert academic international organisation state government local authority official also definition qualify human right international based fact city sometimes articulate human right charter way formal immediate recognition international law may anticipate appropriation international body incorporation international law author claim definition capture better different way city engage human right participate coproduction simply receiver also agent human right analyst observed growing number city since human right city always identify often called human right city based fact engage human right broadly speaking human right city emerged late global human right movement well municipal movement reflect effort activist group local government official improve respect human right principle local community level focus local context human right city tend emphasize economic social cultural right affect life resident city community ability enjoy civil political human right human right city concept also intertwined innovation human right practice arisen local level right city human right advocate describe human right city “ one whose resident local authority learning relevance human right daily life guided steering committee join ongoing learning discussion systematic analysis critical thinking community level pursue creative exchange idea joint planning action realize economic social political civil cultural human right ” human right city defined world human right city forum gwangju south korea local community sociopolitical process local context human right play key role fundamental value guiding principle european charter safeguarding human right city global charteragenda human right city also provided relevant framework various practice led different city across world history human right city movement human right city initiative result longstanding effort popular group defend promote human right thus represents aspect global human right struggle also seen consequence increasing level decentralization local autonomy across world led increasing level awareness political initiative among local government origin right city people movement human right learning contemporary human right city initiative grow directly earlier organizing around right claim urban setting widespread nature urban problem affecting people everyday life survival generated similar type response place around world helping account simultaneous emergence consolidation popular claim right city according david harvey “ invoke right city mean ‘ claim kind shaping power process urbanization way city made remade fundamental radical way ’ idea inspiring movement first emerged many influenced henri lefebvres book le droit à la ville movement expanded gained momentum around world since mids proliferation financial crisis urban austerity environmental damage contributed rise growing number city around world referring explicitly international human right policy statement program formally named “ human right city ” initiative launched people movement human right lear
Distance decay,"Distance decay is a geographical term which describes the effect of distance on cultural or spatial interactions.  The distance decay effect states that the interaction between two locales declines as the distance between them increases. Once the distance is outside of the two locales' activity space, their interactions begin to decrease. It is thus an assertion that the mathematics of the inverse square law in physics can be applied to many geographic phenomena, and is one of the ways in which physics principles such as gravity are often applied metaphorically to geographic situations.

Mathematical models
Distance decay is graphically represented by a curving line that swoops concavely downward as distance along the x-axis increases.  Distance decay can be mathematically represented as an inverse-square law by the expression

  
    
      
        I
        =
        
          constant
        
        ×
        
          d
          
            −
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle I={\text{constant}}\times d^{-2}}
  

or

  
    
      
        I
        ∝
        1
        
          /
        
        
          d
          
            2
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle I\propto 1/d^{2},}
  

where I is interaction and d is distance. In practice, it is often parameterized to fit a specific situation, such as

  
    
      
        I
        =
        
          
            A
            
              (
              d
              +
              B
              
                )
                
                  k
                
              
            
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle I={\frac {A}{(d+B)^{k}}},}
  

in which the constant A is a vertical stretching factor, B is a horizontal shift (so that the curve has a y-axis intercept at a finite value), and k is the decay power.
It can take other forms such as negative exponential, i.e.

  
    
      
        I
        ∝
        
          e
          
            −
            d
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle I\propto e^{-d}.}
  

In addition to fitting the parameters, a cutoff value can be added to a distance decay function to specify a distance beyond which spatial interaction drops to zero, or to delineate a ""zone of indifference"" in which all interactions have the same strength.

Applications
Distance decay is evident in town/city centres. It can refer to various things which decline with greater distance from the center of the central business district (CBD):

density of pedestrian traffic
street quality
quality of shops (depending on definitions of 'quality' and 'center')
height of buildings
price of land
Distance decay weighs into the decision to migrate, leading many migrants to move less far.
With the advent of faster travel and communications technology, such as telegraphs, telephones, broadcasting, and internet, the effects of distance have been reduced, a trend known as  time-space convergence. Exceptions include places previously connected by now-abandoned railways, for example, have fallen off the beaten path.

Related concepts
Related terms include ""friction of distance"", which describes the forces that create the distance decay effect. Waldo R. Tobler's ""First law of geography"", an informal statement that ""All things are related, but near things are more related than far things,"" and the mathematical principle spatial autocorrelation are similar expressions of distance decay effects.
""Loss of Strength Gradient"" holds that the amount of a nation's military power that could be brought to bear in any part of the world depends on geographic distance.

Bioregion,"A bioregion is a geographical area, on land or at sea, defined not by administrative boundaries, but by distinct characteristics such as plant and animal species, ecological systems, soils and landforms, human settlements, and topographic features such as watersheds. The idea of bioregions were adopted and popularized in the mid-1970s by a school of philosophy called bioregionalism, which includes the concept that human culture, in practice, can influence bioregional definitions due to its affect on non-cultural factors. Bioregions are part of a nested series of ecological scales, generally starting with local watersheds, growing into larger river systems, then Level III or IV ecoregions (or regional ecosystems), bioregions, then biogeographical realm, followed by the continental-scale and ultimately the biosphere.
Within the life sciences, there are numerous methods used to define the physical limits of a bioregion based on the spatial extent of mapped ecological phenomena—from species distributions and hydrological systems (i.e. Watersheds) to topographic features (e.g. landforms) and climate zones (e.g. Köppen classification). Bioregions also provide an effective framework in the field of Environmental history, which seeks to use ""river systems, ecozones, or mountain ranges as the basis for understanding the place of human history within a clearly delineated environmental context"". A bioregion can also have a distinct cultural identity defined, for example, by Indigenous Peoples whose historical, mythological and biocultural connections to their lands and waters shape an understanding of place and territorial extent. Within the context of bioregionalism, bioregions can be socially constructed by modern-day communities for the purposes of better understanding a place, ""with the aim to live in that place sustainably and respectfully.""
Bioregions have practical applications in the study of biology, biocultural anthropology, biogeography, biodiversity, bioeconomics, bioregionalism, Bioregional Financing Facilities, bioregional mapping, community health, ecology, environmental history, environmental science, foodsheds, geography, natural resource management, urban Ecology, and urban planning. References to the term ""bioregion"" in scholarly literature have grown exponentially since the introduction of the term—from a single research paper in 1971 to approximately 65,000 journal articles and books published to date. Governments and multilateral institutions have utilized bioregions in mapping Ecosystem Services and tracking progress towards conservation objectives, such as ecosystem representation.

First uses of ""bioregion""
The first confirmed use of the term ""bioregion"" in academic literature was by E. Jarowski in 1971, a marine biologist studying the blue crab populations of Louisiana. The author used the term sensu stricto to refer to a ""biological region""—the area within which a crab can be provided with all the resources needed throughout its entire life cycle. The term was quickly adopted by other biologists, but eventually took on a broader set of definitions to encompass a range of macro-ecological phenomena.
The term bioregion as it relates to bioregionalism is credited to Allen Van Newkirk, a Canadian poet and biogeographer. In this field, the idea of ""bioregion"" probably goes back much earlier than published material suggests, being floated in early published small press zines by Newkirk, and in conversational dialogue. This can be exemplified by the fact that Newkirk had met Peter Berg (another early scholar on bioregionalism) in San Francisco in 1969 and again in Nova Scotia in 1971 where he shared the idea with Berg. He would go on to found the Institute for Bioregional Research and issued a series of short papers using the term bioregion as early as 1970. Peter Berg, who would go on to found the Planet Drum foundation, and become a leading proponent of ""bioregions"" learned of the term in 1971 while Judy Goldhaft and Peter Berg were staying with Allen Van Newkirk, before Berg attended the first United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm during June 1972. The Planet Drum Foundation published their first Bioregional Bundle in that year, that also included a definition of a bioregion. Helping refine this definition, Author Kirkpatrick Sale wrote in 1974 that ""a bioregion is a part of the earth's surface whose rough boundaries are determined by natural rather than human dictates, distinguishable from other areas by attributes of flora, fauna, water, climate, soils and landforms, and human settlements and cultures those attributes give rise to.

Several other marine biology papers picked up the term, and in 1974 the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) published its first global-scale biogeographical map entitled ""Biotic Provinces of the World"".

En plein air,"En plein air (pronounced [ɑ̃ plɛ.n‿ɛʁ]; French for 'outdoors'), or plein-air painting, is the act of painting outdoors.
This method contrasts with studio painting or academic rules that might create a predetermined look. The theory of 'En plein air' painting is credited to Pierre-Henri de Valenciennes (1750–1819), first expounded in a treatise titled Reflections and Advice to a Student on Painting, Particularly on Landscape (1800), where he developed the concept of landscape portraiture by which the artist paints directly onto canvas in situ within the landscape.
It enabled the artist to better capture the changing details of weather and light. The invention of portable canvases and easels allowed the practice to develop, particularly in France, and in the early 1830s the Barbizon School of painting in natural light was highly influential.
Amongst the most prominent features of this school were its tonal qualities, colour, loose brushwork, and softness of form. These were variants that were particularly relevant to the mid 19th-century Hudson River School and to Impressionism.

History
Before the 19th century, artists had mixed their own paints from raw pigments that they often ground themselves from a variety of media. This had made for inconvenient portability and kept most painting activities confined to the studio. However, in the 1830s, the Barbizon school in France that included Charles-François Daubigny and Théodore Rousseau used the practice of en plein air to depict the changing appearance of light accurately as weather conditions altered.
This situation improved later in the 1800s when tubes of oil paint became available, allowing En plein air painting to become viable for more artists. This was in part because of the invention of the collapsible paint tube in 1841 by American portraitist John G. Rand. 
In the early 1860s, four young painters: Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Alfred Sisley and Frédéric Bazille, met whilst studying under the academic artist Charles Gleyre. They discovered that they shared an interest in painting landscape and contemporary life, and they often ventured into the countryside together to paint in the open air. They discovered that they could paint in sunlight directly from nature, and making use of the vivid synthetic pigments that were available, they began to develop a lighter and brighter manner of painting that extended further the Realism of Gustave Courbet and the Barbizon school. It was radical practise at its inception, but by the later decades of the 19th-century the theory had been absorbed into normal artistic practise.
There were artists' colonies across France, such as the one at Étaples on the Côte d'Opal that included landscape impressionists Eugène Chigot and Henri Le Sidaner. The latter artist specialised in translating nocturne light to canvas using oil and pastel.
The Macchiaioli were a group of Italian painters active in Tuscany in the second half of the nineteenth century, who, breaking with the antiquated conventions taught by the Italian academies of art, did much of their painting outdoors in order to capture natural light, shade, and colour. This practice relates the Macchiaioli to the French Impressionists who came to prominence a few years later, although the Macchiaioli pursued somewhat different purposes. Their movement began in Florence in the late 1850s.
In England the Newlyn School was also a major proponent of the technique in the latter 19th century. There were lesser known artist colonies practising, including a loose collective at Amberley in West Sussex centred around the Paris trained Edward Stott who produced atmospheric rural landscapes that were highly popular among some late Victorians.
The movement expanded to America, starting in California then moving to other American locales notable for their natural light qualities, including the Hudson River Valley in New York.
The act of outdoor painting from observation has been continually popular well into the 21st century.

Equipment and challenges
It was during the mid-19th century that the ""box easel"", typically known as the ""French box easel"" or ""field easel"", was invented. It is uncertain who developed it, but these highly portable easels with telescopic legs and built-in paint box and palette made it easier to go into the forest and up the hillsides. Still made today, they remain a popular choice (even for home use) since they fold up to the size of a briefcase and thus are easy to store.
The Pochade Box is a compact box that allows the artist to keep all their supplies and palette within the box and have the work on the inside of the lid.

Social data science,"Social data science is an interdisciplinary field that addresses social science problems by applying or designing computational and digital methods. As the name implies, Social Data Science is located primarily within the social science, but it relies on technical advances in fields like data science, network science, and computer science. The data in Social Data Science is always about human beings and derives from social phenomena, and it could be structured data (e.g. surveys) or unstructured data (e.g. digital footprints). The goal of Social Data Science is to yield new knowledge about social networks, human behavior, cultural ideas and political ideologies.
A social data scientist combines domain knowledge and specialized theories from the social sciences with programming, statistical and other data analysis skills.

Methods
Social data science employs a wide range of quantitative - both established methods in social science as well as new methods developed in computer science and interdisciplinary data science fields such as natural language processing (NLP) and network science.
Social Data Science is closely related to Computational Social Science, but also sometimes includes qualitative data, and mixed digital methods.
Common social data science methods include:
Quantitative methods:

Machine learning
Deep learning
Social network analysis
Randomized controlled trials
Natural language processing (NLP), especially through text as data.
surveys
Qualitative methods:

Interviewing
Observation
Ethnography
Content analysis
Discourse analysis
Mixed digital methods:

Controversy mapping
Spatial analysis
Quali-quantitative methods 
Computational ethnography
One of the pillars of social data science is in the combination of qualitative and quantitative data to analyze social phenomena and develop computationally grounded theories. For example, by using mixed methods to digitize qualitative data and analyzing it via computational methods, or by qualitatively analyzing and interpreting quantitative data.

Data
Social data scientists use both digitized data  (e.g. old books that have been digitized) and natively digital data (e.g. social media posts). Since such data often take the form of found data that were originally produced for other purposes (commercial, governance, etc.) than research, data scraping, cleaning and other forms of preprocessing and data mining occupy a substantial part of a social data scientist's job.
Sources of SDS data include:

Text data
Sensor data
Register data
Survey data
Geo-location data
Observational data

Relations to other fields
Social sciences
Social data science is part of the social sciences along with established disciplines (anthropology, economics, political science, psychology, and sociology) and newer interdisciplinary fields like behavioral science, criminology, international relations, and cognitive science. As such, its fundamental unit of study is social relations, human behavior and cultural ideas, which it investigates by using quantitative and/or qualitative data and methods to develop, test and improve fundamental theories concerning the nature of the human condition. SDS also differs from traditional social science in two ways.

First, its primary object is digitized phenomena and data in the widest sense of this word, ranging from digitized text corpora to the footprints gathered by digital platforms and sensors.
Secondly, more than simply applying existing quantitative and qualitative social science methods, social data science seeks to develop and disrupt these via the import and integration of state of the art of data science techniques

Data Science
Social data science is a form of data science in that it applies advanced computational methods and statistics to gain information and insights from data. Social data science researchers often make use of methods developed by data scientists, such as data mining and machine learning, which includes but is not limited to the extraction and processing of information from big data sources. Unlike the broader field of data science, which involves any application and study involving the combination of computational and statistical methods, social data science mainly concerns the scientific study of digital social data and/or digital footprints from human behavior.

Computational Social Science
Like computational social science, social data science uses data science methods to solve social science problems. This includes the reappropriation and refinement of methods developed by data scientists to better fit the questions and data of the social sciences as well as their specialized domain knowledge and theories. Unlike computational social science, social data science also includes critical studies of how digital platforms and computational processes affect wider society and of how computational and non-computational approaches integrate and combine.

Ocean colonization,"Ocean colonization (also blue colonization or ocean grabbing) is the exploitation, settlement or territorial claim of the ocean and the oceanic crust.
Ocean colonization has been identified critically as a form of colonization and colonialism, particularly in the light of growing exploitive and destructive blue economy ocean development, such as deep sea mining, calls for blue justice have been made.
Ocean colonization as ocean settlement, or seasteading, being the extending of human settlement to the ocean, has been identified as settler colonial ""tech-colonialism"" at sea. Such settlements have been suggested to be established with floating accommodation platforms, such as very large cruise ships or artificial islands, establishing seasteads, or with underwater habitats, employing offshore construction, with arguments for floating structures, as they are generally less impacted by natural disasters. Ocean settlement with the construction of artificial structures in aquatic environments though can also be disruptive to natural marine ecosystems.
Territorial claims are another and continuing international issue, with sovereign states advancing claims through developing and claiming uncontrolled islands, such as in the South China Sea and ocean settlements possibly establishing sovereign states.
Ocean colonization has been advocated for and compared to space colonization, particularly as a proving ground for the latter. In particular, the issue of sovereignty may bear many similarities between ocean and space colonization; adjustments to social life in harsh circumstances would apply similarly to the ocean and to space; and many technologies may have uses in both environments.

Law
The law of the sea internationally negotiated in the latter half of the 20th century states that the ocean is the ""common heritage of humanity"".
From this the need for an international regulation regime has been identified and negotiated for. As the ocean was seen as a technologically optimistic futurist reservoir for economic growth, a model of internationally shared exploitation through a body called the ""Enterprise"" clashed with private commercial exploitation perspectives.
In addition to this economic dimension, environmental protection considerations have produced calls for rights of nature for the ocean.

Construction technologies
Underwater
Underwater habitats are examples of underwater structures.
Submerged structures are sunken, air-tight vessels that either sit at an intermediate position or attached to the ocean floor that create an underwater metropolis for residences and businesses.
H2ome is a project for building sea floor homes, along with high-end resorts and hotels.
Ocean Spiral City is a US$26 billion Japanese project, with research and design under way to potentially house 5,000 people; this may be a reality by 2030.

Offshore
Offshore construction is one of the main forms of ocean colonization.

Land reclamation
Land reclamation is the process of relocating rock or placing cement in a sea, ocean or river bed, to extend or create a new area of livable land in the ocean. This process involves creating a solid base on the sea floor and further building upon it with materials such as clay, sand and soil to form a new island-like structure above the water surface. It therefore expands the area for potential development, supporting the erection of buildings or other necessary urban developments in response to support human activities, by utilizing this otherwise untouched space for more ""productive"" uses. This ocean colonization technique is the most developed in terms of planning and implementation.

Examples
Palm Jumeirah
Palm Jumeirah is the main of three artificial islands in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, to be developed. The name is due to its resemblance to a palm tree when viewed aerially, and is both culturally and symbolically relevant to the coastal city. This land reclamation project began in 2001 and involved the movement of 94 million cubic metres of sand and 5.5 million cubic metres of rock offshore in the Persian Gulf, to allow the development of luxury beachfront villas for both residential and commercial purposes.

Kansai International Airport
Kansai International Airport located in Osaka Bay, Japan was created in 1987, due to overcrowding at the nearby Osaka Airport. Developers suggested Japan's mountainous terrain is not conducive to the development of the flat space required for an airport, and thus developed an artificial island in the bay, with a connecting bridge to support both travel and freight arrivals and departures.

Portier Cove
Portier Cove is an ecodistrict extended off the coast of Monaco and designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the area. The 125 m-long extension project restarted in 2011 and plans to provide a hectare of space for retail, parks, offices, apartments and private villas, to support the nation's growing population.

Western canon,"The Western canon is the embodiment of high-culture literature, music, philosophy, and works of art that are highly cherished across the Western world, such works having achieved the status of classics.
Recent discussions upon the matter emphasise cultural diversity within the canon. The canons of music and visual arts have been broadened to encompass often overlooked periods, whilst recent media like cinema grapple with a precarious position. Criticism arises, with some viewing changes as prioritising activism over aesthetic values, often associated with critical theory, as well as postmodernism. Another critique highlights a narrow interpretation of the West, dominated by British and American culture, at least under contemporary circumstances, prompting demands for a more diversified canon amongst the hemisphere.

Literary canon
Classic book
A classic is a book, or any other work of art, accepted as being exemplary or noteworthy. In the second-century Roman miscellany Attic Nights, Aulus Gellius refers to writers as ""classicus... scriptor, non proletarius"" (""A distinguished, not a commonplace writer""). Such classification were initiated with the Greeks' ranking their cultural works, with the word canon (ancient Greek κανών, kanṓn: ""measuring rod, standard""). Similarly, early Christian Church Fathers declared as canon the authoritative texts of the New Testament, preserving them given the expense of vellum and papyrus and mechanical book reproduction. Thus, being included in a canon ensured a book's preservation as the best way to retain information about a civilization. In contemporary use, the Western canon defines the best of Western culture. In the ancient world, at the Alexandrian Library, scholars coined the Greek term Hoi enkrithentes [""the admitted"", ""the included""] to identify the writers in the canon. Although the term is often associated with the Western canon, it can be applied to works of literature, music and art, etc. from all traditions, such as the Chinese classics.
With regard to books, what makes a book ""classic"" has concerned various authors, from Mark Twain to Italo Calvino, and questions such as ""Why Read the Classics?"", and ""What Is a Classic?"" have been considered by others, including T. S. Eliot, Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve, Michael Dirda, and Ezra Pound.
The terms ""classic book"" and Western canon are closely related concepts, but are not necessarily synonymous. A ""canon"" is a list of books considered to be ""essential"", and it can be published as a collection (such as Great Books of the Western World, Modern Library, Everyman's Library or Penguin Classics), presented as a list with an academic's imprimatur (such as Harold Bloom's), or be the official reading list of a university. In The Western Canon Bloom lists ""the major Western writers"" as Dante Alighieri, Geoffrey Chaucer, Miguel de Cervantes, Michel de Montaigne, William Shakespeare, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, William Wordsworth, Charles Dickens, Leo Tolstoy, James Joyce and Marcel Proust.

Great Books Program
A university or college Great Books Program is a program inspired by the Great Books movement begun in the United States in the 1920s by John Erskine of Columbia University, which proposed to improve the higher education system by returning it to the western liberal arts tradition of broad cross-disciplinary learning. These academics and educators included Robert Hutchins, Mortimer Adler, Stringfellow Barr, Scott Buchanan, Jacques Barzun, and Alexander Meiklejohn. The view among them was that the emphasis on narrow specialization in American colleges had harmed the quality of higher education by failing to expose students to the important products of Western civilization and thought.
The essential component of such programs is a high degree of engagement with primary texts, called the Great Books. The curricula of Great Books programs often follow a canon of texts considered more or less essential to a student's education, such as Plato's Republic, or Dante's Divine Comedy. Such programs often focus exclusively on Western culture. Their employment of primary texts dictates an interdisciplinary approach, as most of the Great Books do not fall neatly under the prerogative of a single contemporary academic discipline. Great Books programs often include designated discussion groups as well as lectures, and have small class sizes. In general students in such programs receive an abnormally high degree of attention from their professors, as part of the overall aim of fostering a community of learning.
Over 100 institutions of higher learning, mostly in the United States, offer some version of a Great Books Program as an option for students.
For much of the 20th century, the Modern Library provided a larger convenient list of the Western canon. The list numbered more than 300 items by the 1950s, by authors from Aristotle to Albert Camus, and has continued to grow.

Wabap,"Wabap (or simply Biguine Wabap) is a subgenre of biguine, a Caribbean music style.

Etymology
The name derives from the traditional refrain wiz-zap wabap sung by sugarcane cutters.

History
According to Al Lirvat, the term was coined by Nelly Lunflas, a revue leader at La Canne à Sucre. The first wabap recordings were made in 1952 by Al Lirvat and Robert Mavounzy. In 1954, a piece by Lirvat sung by Moune de Rivel was titled Biguine Wabap.

Musical Characteristics
Wabap incorporates into biguine a number of assonances and dissonances, altered chords, and complex rhythms in five, six, and seven beats. Banjo disappeared in Wabap and it was replaced by Guitar.
